***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Description ****
The Project will reduce poverty in the rural communities of 11 EDR districts
through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. The project
outcome will be improved efficiency of production, marketing, and processing of
HVCs such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR. The project
outputs include (i) increased public and private investment in commercial
agriculture, (ii) inclusion of poor and semicommercial stakeholders in
commercial agriculture, (iii) timely availability of market information to
farmers, and (iv) enhanced capacity of project partners in supporting farmers.
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
The Project builds on existing initiatives; responds to the needs of
stakeholders; and ensures fairer benefits to poor disadvantaged communities and
women. The Project is timely and based on sound experience; its design is
consistent with ADB?s strategic focus under the CSP to (i) increase
agricultural productivity (ii) increase agricultural income and employment
opportunities for rural people, and (iii) increase commercialization of
agriculture. ADB?s 2005?2009 country strategy and program (CSP) for Nepal links
future ADB assistance to results sought by the Government to deal with the
underlying causes and possible long-term effects of the recent conflict. Broad-
based and inclusive social and economic development to achieve a steady decline
in poverty is the adopted strategy. The results are in line with the objectives
of the Government?s poverty reduction strategy (Tenth Five-Year Plan), which is
built on four pillars: (i) broad-based and higher economic growth, (ii) social
development, (iii) targeted programs for socially excluded groups, and (iv)
good governance. The main thrusts of the CSP are (i) promoting greater
development balance in different regions; (ii) improving access of the poor to
basic services, opportunities for social advancement, and participation in the
development process; and (iii) addressing the needs of disadvantaged ethnic
groups, castes, and women. In project design, the CSP requires (i) simple
design, (ii) service delivery through local stakeholders, (iii) demand-driven
assistance, (iv) results-focused support, (v) flexible implementation
modalities, (vi) community participation with social inclusion in overall
project implementation, and (vii) greater transparency and accountability.
These requirements guided design of the Project and are incorporated in its
framework.

**** Safeguard Categories ****

**** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects ****
Environmental Aspect
The project has been implementing acceptable level of environmental safeguards.
The environmental safeguards are incorporated in subproject concept notes (SCN)
and subproject detail proposals. Implementation is being monitored by
environment consultant, district-based CAA monitoring officers and district
technical office (DTO) staff. The adherence to labor-based approach, disposal
of spoil, drainage management, replantation for cleared trees, protection from
erosion, and encroachment of private land are a few important issues require
carefully screened and addressed in subprojects. Infrastructure built under the
Project are engineered and supervised for quality control by DTO and PMU
engineers and users committees. It was agreed to intensify environmental
monitoring in project implementation; avoid use of private property or submit
as an annex to SCN a consent letter signed by owners and endorsed by village
development committee or an independent NGO confirming that lands were donated
voluntarily to subproject; prohibit use of heavy equipment for construction
works and adopt labor-based approach; replant cleared trees at 1:25 ratio;
carefully implement integrated pest management; and select subprojects based on
priority. It was also agreed to increase technical staff for timely
preparation, implementation monitoring and quality control of infrastructure
subprojects. The quarterly progress report will include a section on status of
environmental safeguards compliance in infrastructure and non-infrastructure
subprojects.
Involuntary Resettlement
There is community infrastructure included in the commercial agriculture
packages but no proposal from the beneficiaries has been accepted that might
involve involuntary resettlement. However, the resettlement component is
reflected in each of the proposal selection criteria. While selection of
subprojects, the Project is carefully considering that no person is adversely
affected due to land acquisition, resettlement or land donation and in terms of
ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the prevailing laws and
regulations of the country.
Indigenous Peoples
The Project has no negative impact on indigenous people. The Project has been
addressing the issues of social and economic exclusion through its component 2:
inclusive development of stakeholders, which assists disadvantaged people and
poor subsistence farmers to develop and participate in income-generating
agricultural activities. Social Development Specialist at PMU has been
assisting in ensuring the equitable distribution of project resources and equal
access to project activities and structures. The associated JFPR grant targets
and benefits the most disadvantaged people by focusing on building their
capacity and on income generation opportunities through a specialized package
of targeted support to ensure their participation. The Project has made a
considerable progress in achieving the targets. Out of 274 CAA members, women
comprise 48%, dalit 6%, janajati 41%, and others4 53%, which meets the GAP
target. Of the total CAA members, farmer groups are 47%, cooperatives 32%,
traders 11%, and processors 10%. Out of the total farmer groups, women only
groups are 12%, while women only cooperatives are 20%. Rest of the farmer
groups and cooperatives has women and men members. The traders (16) and
processors (13) are mostly male groups. Of the total 25,144 subsistence and
semi-commercial members, women are in high numbers 66% subsistence and 51%
semi-commercial. Similarly, representation of dalit (26%) and janajati (53%)
are also high in subsistence groups. The Project has institutionalized the
systemic collection of disaggregated data from the field to centre, and proper
formats have been used for periodic monitoring and reporting.
**** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation ****
During Project Design
Participatory design workshops with stakeholders conducted at several stages
during PPTA implementation.
During Project Implementation
The Project will reduce rural poverty in the EDR through equitable and
sustainable commercialization of agriculture. Impacts include increased
economic activities and jobs in the project area. Social inclusion activities
will promote the participation of all stakeholders including the poor,
disadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; help them receive fair
benefits from such participation; and in turn contribute to restoring peace and
stability in the EDR. The Project will directly generate employment
opportunities for subsistence stakeholders by promoting HVC production and
marketing, transporting products from the field to storage and processing
centers, and assisting small-scale community-based market infrastructure
development. The landless poor will, through skill-based training, be made more
employable and capable of income generation. Commercial stakeholders will be
assisted to add value to agriculture products and encouraged to adopt socially
inclusive behavior to help the less advantaged.
