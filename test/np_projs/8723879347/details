***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
The rapid urban population growth, coupled with the Government?s inability to
keep pace with the demand for infrastructure and services has led to a series
of urban environmental concerns in the secondary towns and constraining the
economic growth of Nepal. Urban sector economy plays a key role for providing
services and employment opportunities to the rural hinterland. Nepal?s Country
Strategy and Program (CSP) (2005-2009) promotes investments to meet the urgent
need for safe water supply and sanitation services in urban areas observing
rapid urbanization, aiming to foster inclusive social development. Nepal is
ranked 142nd out of 177 countries in terms of human development index shown in
the Human Development Report 2007/2008, which clearly warrants further needs of
social development. Although proportion of population with access to clean
drinking water is reported at rather high 76.6% in 2006 by the Government,
figures substantially vary depending on the source, and water supply is still
considered insufficient in both volume and quality even in Kathmandu, the
capital. Situation for sanitation and solid waste management is even worse,
thus necessitating urgent intervention in these sub-sectors. Investments in
these sub-sectors in selected secondary towns, catching up with the rapid and
haphazard urbanization, are essential for providing clean and developed urban
environment in line with the National Urban Policy (NUP) 2007. Moreover, the
CSP and NUP address the need to strengthen rural-urban connectivity for
promoting broad-based economic growth. Therefore, other urban infrastructure,
such as improvement of road network, bus terminals and markets, would play an
important role in enhancing rural-urban links. These approaches are still valid
and confirmed in Nepal Country Operations Business Plan (2008-2010) and the
latest Country Programming Mission conducted in April 2008, though the
political and security context in Nepal has changed since the preparation of
the CSP. The proposed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and
ensuing Project intends to support the Government for an inclusive social
development and broad-based economic growth through provision of environmental
and other urban infrastructure in selected secondary towns by taking an
integrated approach. The Project will build on the lessons learned under the
on-going Urban and Environmental Improvement Project (Loan 1966-NEP), in
particular in terms of implementation framework and financial arrangement.
**** Impact ****
Improved quality of life and higher economic growth in selected secondary towns
in Nepal.
**** Project Outcome ****
Description of Outcome
Project design and feasibility study that the borrower and ADB have agreed
upon.
**** Implementation Progress ****
Description of Project Outputs
The PPTA plans to deliver the following two main outputs: (i) preparation of
feasibility study; and (ii) formulation of appropriate institutional and
implementation framework. The first component will strategically select three
to five target secondary towns with high economic growth potential and urgent
needs for urban environmental improvement and supplementary urban facilities in
line with the relevant development policy and strategy, after carefully
examining commitment, capacity and readiness of candidate secondary towns.
Then, the work is carried out to identify sub-projects and prepare overall
investment package, including safeguard reports. The investment package will
cover provision of infrastructure for urban environmental improvement mainly
for household services such as water supply, sanitation (wastewater treatment),
drainage and solid waste management, and supplementary urban facilities such as
urban road, bus terminals, city parks and markets, and may include seed money
for land pooling. Moreover, economic activities such as cold storage facilities
may be considered under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Social and
poverty assessment will be undertaken and mechanisms for improving access to
and quality of basic urban services for the poor will be assessed. The second
component will include institutional assessment of central as well as local
bodies, from technical, financial and managerial viewpoints. On the basis of
review of current status and direction of decentralization/devolution,
appropriate institutional and financial arrangements will be proposed, together
with comprehensive capacity building programs. These two components will be
implemented in tandem in a closely coordinated manner. The PPTA will be
implemented over a period of 8 months in two phases. The first phase of the
PPTA will be executed in 3 months, when three to five target secondary towns
will be determined. The second phase will be implemented over a period of 5
months for preparation of overall investment package and formulation of
institutional and implementation framework.
**** Safeguard Categories ****
Environment: B
Involuntary Resettlement:
Indigenous Peoples:
**** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects ****
The PPTA will undertake socioeconomic surveys, and prepare resettlement plans
and environmental assessment reports such as initial environmental examination
(IEE) for subprojects, as needed. Though subprojects are not expected to impose
significant adverse environmental and social impacts, safeguard plans will be
carefully developed in order to obtain public acceptance and thus not cause
potential delay in implementation.
**** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation ****
During Project Design
Discussions will be held with officials of relevant government ministries and
departments, and development partners including NGOs actively engaged in urban
environmental improvement.
 
Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or
program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be
included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.
Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.
