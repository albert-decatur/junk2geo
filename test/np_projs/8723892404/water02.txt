Narrative Summary
Objectively Verifiable Indicators
Means of Verification
Super Goal
Safe drinking water will be supplied stably in Semi-urban
areas in Nepal.

Overall Goal
DWSS technical support model for WUSCs established by the
Project will be disseminated to all over the country by MoPPW
& DWSS.

Number of households of which the safe
drinking water can be supplied will be
supplied.

1. Statistics Reports of MoPPW
(5 Years Plan, etc.)
2. Statistics of MDGs

1. The number of WUSCs which are
strengthened by the support of DWSS
is increased XX% of all WUSC.
2. The DWSS technical support model
reflects to annual schedules of every
RMSO & DWSSDO.

1. &2. DWSS annual report

Project Purpose
DWSS technical support system to WUSCs is improved in
Morang and Jhapa districts.

December 2008
Important Assumption

1. Based on the technical support manual
established by DWSS /RMSO/ WSSDO,
the support system to XX % of all
WUSC in Jhapa/Morang is
implemented.
2. The Safe drinking water services by 3
WUSCs is improved in comparison
with the beginning of the Project.

1-1 WUSC annual report
(Management, Water quality
Monitoring, Future business
plan)
2-1 DWSS monitoring report
2-2 Annual/periodical reports of
DWSS/RMSO/WSSDO
2-3 Support Activity Report of
WSSDO

1. The constructions of
appropriate Water Supply
facilities are promoted.
2. People’s awareness for
the importance of the safe
water is improved.

1. Necessary budget for
expansion of WUSC
support model in
semi-urban area is
allocated.

Output
1. Basic information for the Project and necessary information
for indicators are collected, and water supply management
of the Project is appropriately executed.

1-1 PDM is revised.
1-2 Monitoring for indicators is regularly
executed.

1-1 Revised PDM
1-2 Monitoring report

1. National Water Policy is
not changed drastically.

2. “Small and medium-sized water supply support model” and
“Small and medium-sized water supply management model”
are collected as models for WSSDO/ERMSO and WUSC.

2-1 “Small and medium-sized water
supply support model” manual and
“Small and medium-sized water supply
management model” manual are
completed.

2-1 “Small and medium-sized
water supply management
model”
2-2 “The support manual for
WUSC”

2. Authority of DWSS
including
ERMSO/WSSDO is not
changed drastically.

3. Model of Output2 is disseminated in Jhapa/Morang districts.

3-1 XX % of all WUSCs in Jhapa/Morang
districts make a plan to conduct
“Small and medium-sized water
supply management model”.

3-1 WUSC annual reports
3-2 ERMSO/WSSDO/DWSS
annual report

3. Counterpart personnel of
the Project works
continuously in project
period.
