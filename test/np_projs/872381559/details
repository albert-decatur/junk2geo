implementation plan. There is still need to intensify TEVT awareness especially
at the community level.They are also using NGOs associated with dalit and
disadvantage group for awareness activities. Ongoing. Different approaches of
creating awarenss have been implemented. It is recommended that massive
awareness campaign need to be utilized. It is also suggested that targeted
awareness program for women and dalit have to be done.The Project has started
the street drama in Kathmandu. But it needs to be taken to the community. b.

Geographical information system (GIS) and training management information
system (TMIS), have been established. The CTEVT has to make the system
functional. The Mission during the Review of December 2010 met with the
Secretary and senior officials of the Ministry of Labour and Transport
Management (MOLTM) on the pending issues of labor management information system
(LMIS) and employment service centers (ESCs). In this connection, MOLTM clearly
stated they are committed to make LMIS and ESCs operational and the project

selected public training providers. Supporting Policy Development,
Articulation, and Implementation Status:After MOE's request to NPC to take
coordination responsibility for finalizing implementation plan of TEVT policy,
NPC organized the first meeting in May 2009. However, the work was not
progressing well due to limited support by other line ministries. In the mean
time a high level committee, under the chairmanship of the Minister for
Education with representation of various public and private agencies, was set
up in February 2010 to prepare a TEVT policy framework and submit to the
Government. The Committee under the NPC set up a sub-committee to facilitate
the work of the ministerial level committee, and the sub-committee submitted a
concise report containing strategies and corresponding actions for TEVT policy
