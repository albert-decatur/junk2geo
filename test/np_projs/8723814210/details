***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
Food security in Nepal is alarmingly low, with 49% of children under 5 years
old stunted, 25% severely stunted, 13% wasted, and 3% severely wasted. The
majority of small and marginal farmers cannot achieve their productivity
potential since they have unreliable or no access to irrigation water and
improved agricultural technology. Small farmers without irrigation include the
disadvantaged Dalit, Janajati and Muslim populations who live and cultivate
rain-fed land in peripheral water-scarce areas on steep slopes away from
fertile and water-rich valleys in the hills and on the fringes of irrigation
systems in the plains. Irrigation is key to increasing the production of staple
crops to meet the growing gap between agricultural production and the needs of
the expanding population and to diversifying and intensifying agriculture to
increase on-farm incomes, reduce rural poverty, and increase food security.
Irrigation therefore has a critical role to play in Nepal s poverty reduction
and food security strategies. For individuals and households, access to
irrigation reduces the severity of rural poverty by increasing (i) food
production, (ii) on-farm employment, and (iii) incomes. The project addresses
the three pillars of ADB's country partnership strategy, 2010-2012: (i) broad-
based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and
(iii) governance and capacity building. It builds on lessons learned from past
assistance in the agriculture and natural resources sector and complements the
interventions of other development partners. The project supports the
multisector approach advocated in ADB's Operational Plan for Sustainable Food
Security, as it aims to improve water productivity, access to microfinance, and
the application of improved agricultural practices. The project's interventions
will be underpinned by associated capacity building at district and community
levels.
**** Impact ****
Agricultural income of rural poor and socially excluded groups is increased.
**** Project Outcome ****
Description of Outcome
Poor, women, and other disadvantaged farmers in target communities intensify
and diversify their agricultural practices toward higher value crops.
Progress Towards Outcome
Outputs towards achieving outcome have not yet been started/not yet due.
**** Implementation Progress ****
Description of Project Outputs
WUAs efficiently manage improved irrigation infrastructure. Participating
farmers apply improved agriculture practices and have access to microfinance.
Government capacity to plan and coordinate small-scale irrigation projects is
enhanced.
Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress
Till now 168 WUA are Registered. They are having 36% (>33%) female and
proportional representation of DAG in membership is complied. Pre-construction
training was conducted focusing enhancement of WUA capacity in planning
implementation, and operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure.
Training on water management plan is being provided to WUAs after completion of
construction works. WUA of completed subprojects already started to implement.
There is WUA commitment at the time of subproject demand and will be complied
at the time of completion. It will be assessed only after the completion and
operation of the ISPs. RMDC trained MFIs are forming farmers saving & credit
groups meeting the target of female participants. Project selection is done
according to the project selection criteria by the village leaders. Training
plan have been prepared and CIP engineers and sub engineers were trained for
project design and implementation. DDC/DTO is coordinating the works with DADO
and other district government officials. Provision has been made in the plan
and will be executed. Training/Observation tour for LDO/DTO is completed. CIP
engineers training are being conducted regularly.
**** Safeguard Categories ****
Environment: B
Involuntary Resettlement: C
Indigenous Peoples: B
**** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects ****
Environmental Aspect
A Project Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) guides the
preparation of environmental due diligence for the subprojects. Environmental
due diligence is incorporated into the Feasibility Assessment Reports. In
accordance with the EARF, Initial Environmental Examinations will be prepared
for irrigation subprojects with 150 ha or more of command area. So far, no
subproject more than 150 ha has been demanded by farmers.
Involuntary Resettlement
No involuntary resettlement will be used in the Project, as the Project's
subproject selection criteria requires that the irrigation improvement is
desired by the community and WUA members voluntarily donate any small parcels
of land needed for irrigation enhancement. A Resettlement Framework has been
prepared to ensure the subproject selection criteria have been met, and to
clearly identify the triggers, if any, for more comprehensive safeguards (i.e.
resettlement plan). Resettlement due diligence is required to be incorporated
into each subproject Feasibility Assessment Report, and will document
verification that any land required has been given voluntarily, and that nobody
is impoverished by the land donation. If more than 5% of anyone's total land
holding is donated, the WUAs must negotiate livelihood restitution measures
with the affected party.
Indigenous Peoples
Indigenous peoples (IPs) are not expected to be affected seriously or at all by
the Project, whether it is through loss of livelihoods, displacements, or
impacts on their social and cultural identity. Impacts on IPs are expected to
be positive, as IPs living in subproject areas will benefit from the access to
irrigation, increased agricultural yields, and improved food security. The
Project's Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework guides the preparation of
subprojects to ensure equitable distribution of benefits and to promote
development of the IPs and ethnic minorities along with other disadvantaged
groups. The Feasibility Assessment Reports must document due diligence on IPs
to ensure that there are no adverse effects on IPs and that interventions are
designed with greatest possible reduction of poverty among IPs.
**** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation ****
During Project Design
Identification of ISPs are done with wide consultation and information
dissemination to the farmers at grass root level. Communities are continually
consulted at all stage of the ISPs. The project is planning to organize a
multistakeholder workshop on the project activities in near future.
During Project Implementation
The Project has a Consultation and Participation Plan. This plan has been
prepared to ensure local ownership of each CIP subproject, ensure inclusion of
all types of user stakeholder groups in participation processes and benefit
distribution, and to ensure dissemination of results and lessons learned to the
wider community, including interested government, NGOs and civil society
organizations. The socio-economic survey of each subproject will flag those
households requiring support to enhance their meaningful participation in the
activities of the project. These groups will receive targeted coaching. The
Project Coordination Unit will analyze each sub-project based on its socio-
economic profile and suggest targets and methods for participation assistance.
They will also provide training support to the field teams in this respect. In
order to ensure the project may learn from other relevant activities and vice
versa, the Project Coordination Unit will invite government organizations, NGOs
and community-based organizations to periodic workshops to discuss project
results, and in particular periodic specialized studies on such topics as
gender, poverty impact or other case studies. During the inception mission the
stakeholder consultation and participation plan prepared at PPTA stage was
reviewed and revised.The following have been integrated: targeted participation
actions for social preparation, community and WUA meetings, and training events
from each of the safeguard documents into the plan.
 
Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or
program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be
included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.
Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.
