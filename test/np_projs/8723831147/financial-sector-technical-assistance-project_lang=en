****** Projects & Operations ******
The World Bank's projects and operations are designed to support low-income and
middle-income countries' poverty reduction strategies. Countries develop
strategies around a range of reforms and investments likely to improve people's
lives from universal education to passable roads, from quality health care to
improved governance and inclusive economic growth. In parallel, the Bank
strives to align its assistance with the country's priorities and harmonize its
aid program with other agencies to boost aid effectiveness.
