***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the region with a population of about
24 million people scattered throughout remote mountainous villages. Several
structural factors hindering the country?s attempts at development include: (i)
the difficult terrain of a mountainous, landlocked country, (ii) low levels of
physical infrastructure resulting in many remote areas without connectivity to
the rest of the country, and (iii) lack of good governance. An overall level of
telephone density for both fixed and cellular services is low. Many villages do
not have access to telecoms services. Broadcasting services are not available
to all villages. Information and communications technology (ICT) services are
limited to major urban areas. The decentralization of economic activities away
from Kathmandu Valley is hampered by the lack of basic infrastructure and poor
communications system. With these constraints, Nepal has a huge potential to
take full advantage of ICT, as it allows distribution of, and access to,
information at no cost difference regardless of different spatial distances.
Particularly in Nepal, the benefits of e-government will be far more extensive,
especially compared with its networking cost. A majority of people living in
remote areas could be empowered by ICT to gain access to public services at as
affordable a price as enjoyed by people in Kathmandu Valley.
**** Safeguard Categories ****
Environment: B
Involuntary Resettlement: B

**** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects ****
Any negative social and environmental impact will be minimal. Social and
environmental aspects will be properly addressed. Environmental impact
mitigation and land acquisition, if any, will be implemented and strictly
monitored.
 
Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or
program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be
included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.
Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.
