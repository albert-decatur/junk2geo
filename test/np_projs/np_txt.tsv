Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Food security in Nepal is alarmingly low, with 49% of children under 5 years old stunted, 25% severely stunted, 13% wasted, and 3% severely wasted. The majority of small and marginal farmers cannot achieve their productivity potential since they have unreliable or no access to irrigation water and improved agricultural technology. Small farmers without irrigation include the disadvantaged Dalit, Janajati and Muslim populations who live and cultivate rain-fed land in peripheral water-scarce areas on steep slopes away from fertile and water-rich valleys in the hills and on the fringes of irrigation systems in the plains. Irrigation is key to increasing the production of staple crops to meet the growing gap between agricultural production and the needs of the expanding population and to diversifying and intensifying agriculture to increase on-farm incomes, reduce rural poverty, and increase food security. Irrigation therefore has a critical role to play in Nepal s poverty reduction and food security strategies. For individuals and households, access to irrigation reduces the severity of rural poverty by increasing (i) food production, (ii) on-farm employment, and (iii) incomes. The project addresses the three pillars of ADB's country partnership strategy, 2010-2012: (i) broad- based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) governance and capacity building. It builds on lessons learned from past assistance in the agriculture and natural resources sector and complements the interventions of other development partners. The project supports the multisector approach advocated in ADB's Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, as it aims to improve water productivity, access to microfinance, and the application of improved agricultural practices. The project's interventions will be underpinned by associated capacity building at district and community levels. **** Impact **** Agricultural income of rural poor and socially excluded groups is increased. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Poor, women, and other disadvantaged farmers in target communities intensify and diversify their agricultural practices toward higher value crops. Progress Towards Outcome Outputs towards achieving outcome have not yet been started/not yet due. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs WUAs efficiently manage improved irrigation infrastructure. Participating farmers apply improved agriculture practices and have access to microfinance. Government capacity to plan and coordinate small-scale irrigation projects is enhanced. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Till now 168 WUA are Registered. They are having 36% (>33%) female and proportional representation of DAG in membership is complied. Pre-construction training was conducted focusing enhancement of WUA capacity in planning implementation, and operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. Training on water management plan is being provided to WUAs after completion of construction works. WUA of completed subprojects already started to implement. There is WUA commitment at the time of subproject demand and will be complied at the time of completion. It will be assessed only after the completion and operation of the ISPs. RMDC trained MFIs are forming farmers saving & credit groups meeting the target of female participants. Project selection is done according to the project selection criteria by the village leaders. Training plan have been prepared and CIP engineers and sub engineers were trained for project design and implementation. DDC/DTO is coordinating the works with DADO and other district government officials. Provision has been made in the plan and will be executed. Training/Observation tour for LDO/DTO is completed. CIP engineers training are being conducted regularly. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: C Indigenous Peoples: B **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect A Project Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) guides the preparation of environmental due diligence for the subprojects. Environmental due diligence is incorporated into the Feasibility Assessment Reports. In accordance with the EARF, Initial Environmental Examinations will be prepared for irrigation subprojects with 150 ha or more of command area. So far, no subproject more than 150 ha has been demanded by farmers. Involuntary Resettlement No involuntary resettlement will be used in the Project, as the Project's subproject selection criteria requires that the irrigation improvement is desired by the community and WUA members voluntarily donate any small parcels of land needed for irrigation enhancement. A Resettlement Framework has been prepared to ensure the subproject selection criteria have been met, and to clearly identify the triggers, if any, for more comprehensive safeguards (i.e. resettlement plan). Resettlement due diligence is required to be incorporated into each subproject Feasibility Assessment Report, and will document verification that any land required has been given voluntarily, and that nobody is impoverished by the land donation. If more than 5% of anyone's total land holding is donated, the WUAs must negotiate livelihood restitution measures with the affected party. Indigenous Peoples Indigenous peoples (IPs) are not expected to be affected seriously or at all by the Project, whether it is through loss of livelihoods, displacements, or impacts on their social and cultural identity. Impacts on IPs are expected to be positive, as IPs living in subproject areas will benefit from the access to irrigation, increased agricultural yields, and improved food security. The Project's Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework guides the preparation of subprojects to ensure equitable distribution of benefits and to promote development of the IPs and ethnic minorities along with other disadvantaged groups. The Feasibility Assessment Reports must document due diligence on IPs to ensure that there are no adverse effects on IPs and that interventions are designed with greatest possible reduction of poverty among IPs. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Identification of ISPs are done with wide consultation and information dissemination to the farmers at grass root level. Communities are continually consulted at all stage of the ISPs. The project is planning to organize a multistakeholder workshop on the project activities in near future. During Project Implementation The Project has a Consultation and Participation Plan. This plan has been prepared to ensure local ownership of each CIP subproject, ensure inclusion of all types of user stakeholder groups in participation processes and benefit distribution, and to ensure dissemination of results and lessons learned to the wider community, including interested government, NGOs and civil society organizations. The socio-economic survey of each subproject will flag those households requiring support to enhance their meaningful participation in the activities of the project. These groups will receive targeted coaching. The Project Coordination Unit will analyze each sub-project based on its socio- economic profile and suggest targets and methods for participation assistance. They will also provide training support to the field teams in this respect. In order to ensure the project may learn from other relevant activities and vice versa, the Project Coordination Unit will invite government organizations, NGOs and community-based organizations to periodic workshops to discuss project results, and in particular periodic specialized studies on such topics as gender, poverty impact or other case studies. During the inception mission the stakeholder consultation and participation plan prepared at PPTA stage was reviewed and revised.The following have been integrated: targeted participation actions for social preparation, community and WUA meetings, and training events from each of the safeguard documents into the plan.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 17 May 2010     * Fact-finding: 17 May 2010 to 28 May 2010     * Management Review Meeting: 30 Apr 2007     * Approval: 27 Sep 2010     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

872381497	Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized  PROJECT INFORMATION DOCUMENT (PID) APPRAISAL STAGE Report No.: AB3799 Nepal Peace Support Project  Project Name Region Sector Project ID Borrower(s) Implementing Agency Environment Category Date PID Prepared Date of Appraisal Authorization Date of Board Approval  SOUTH ASIA Other social services (100%) P110762 GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, Government of Nepal [ ] A [ ] B [X] C [ ] FI April 3, 2008 March 12, 2008 April 22, 2008  1. Country and Sector Background Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, averaging GDP per capita of US$270 in 2005, with adverse, though in some cases improving, social indicators. Despite this, the country has made substantial progress in poverty reduction in the decade to 2003/04, with the headcount rate falling from 42 to 31 percent. This is remarkable considering that an armed conflict ran from 1996 to 2006 which imposed a heavy toll in terms of human lives: over 14,000 people were killed, many displaced (with estimates over recent years ranging from around 25,000 to around 100,000 people), and others disabled or “disappeared”. As such, unresolved tensions remain in many parts of the country. In the past two years, a fragile peace has been sustained - though not without ongoing unrest and periodic political setbacks – and important steps have been taken towards a “new Nepal”. This includes establishment of the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) in November 2005 with involvement of the Maoists, ending of royal rule in April 2006 and immediate establishment of an interim SPA Government, signing of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party (CPN-Maoist) in November 2006 and subsequently CPN-M joined government in April 2007, and promulgation of an interim Constitution in 2007. Elections are now scheduled for April 2008 for a Constituent Assembly (CA) which would draft a new Constitution and be the basis for formation of a new government. The CA elections had twice been postponed, the second postponement induced by a shortlived Maoist withdrawal from the coalition in late 2007. The Maoists re-entered Government following the signing of the 23 Point Agreement (23PA) between the members of the SPA in December 2007. A second set of developments over the past year has been considerable unrest - including bandhs, intermittent violence (including killings), disruption of non-Madhesi political meetings, etc., – in the Terai region by groups promoting the interests of Madhesi. However, at the end of February 2008, agreements have been signed between GON and major Madhesi political blocs which should help to calm such tensions. These agreements, however, will imply significant financial obligations for the incoming government which will create additional pressure on fiscal resources. Confidence is growing that CA elections will be conducted as planned on April 10, 2008 in a timely and effective manner; just as importantly, the post-electoral period will open up a new set of challenges to the peace and nation-building processes. These will require sustained confidence building between all  stakeholders. The most immediate will be the process of formation of a new Government which will likely be a multi-party coalition with involvement of both sides to the conflict. Another challenge will be meeting the wide-ranging commitments to different population groups which have been made in the recent past. A final challenge facing Government will be the systematic and substantive review and reform of the security system – in particular the political challenge of a proposed integration of the Maoists in cantonments and the financial challenge of sustaining such an integration. These and other challenges will require sustaining the existing level of confidence among different political parties and deepening it over time in order to consolidate the peace and start the transition from an emphasis on post-conflict to developmental policies. Meeting prior commitments that have financial implications, particularly to the different groups affected by the conflict, will be critical to not only bolster this confidence building and transition process; but also, protect the on-going pro-poor expenditures initiated during the Tenth Plan. The 23PA outlines several key agreements between the parties with respect to the ongoing peace process which provide the specific context for the proposed operation. These include: (i) payment of outstanding allowances to Maoists in cantonments, agreement to make future allowance payments, and to engage in further deliberations on their reintegration following eventual release from cantonments; (ii) commitment to provide compensation payments to families of those killed as a result of the conflict; (iii) provision for rapid release and payment of allowances to those in cantonments who were not verified as eligible by reason of being under age or having entered cantonment after a prior cut-off date; and (iv) commitment that private and public property seized during the armed conflict will be returned to concerned individuals and agencies. Primary responsibility for implementation of these commitments rests with the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction (MOPR). The institutional architecture in GON for dealing with different aspects of the peace and reconstruction process is summarized in the 23 Point Agreement. There is commitment to formation of several high level Commissions tasked with guiding different aspects of the peace process. A key institution in this respect is the High Level Peace Commission, intended to be a body with cross-party representation which acts as the policy and oversight body with respect to the peace process. It is required under the 23PA to coordinate closely with the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction. The Commission is expected to be formed in the near future. Apart from governmental institutions, a range of UN, international and national agencies are supporting different aspects of the peace process. The coordinating agency among the UN agencies is the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN), a special political mission established by the UN Security Council to support the peace process in Nepal and in particular to assist in the conduct of the CA election in a free and fair atmosphere. A second important institution is the Nepal Peace Trust Fund (NPTF) the coordinating mechanism for bilateral donors involved in supporting the peace process.  2. Objectives The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the consolidation of the peace process in Nepal by supporting: (i) Government to meet commitments to people affected by the conflict, including families of the deceased, orphans, widows and disabled people, and Maoists in cantonments; (ii) ensuring transparency in implementation of benefits under the Project for the conflict-affected groups including the Maoists in cantonments; and (iii) strengthening of key institutions which are tasked with policy and implementation functions in peace building, reintegration and rehabilitation.  3. Rationale for Bank Involvement  The rationale for Bank involvement has several elements in light of the request from GON for urgent support. The first is that the Bank has considerable international experience in providing support to peace processes, specifically dealing with conflict-affected populations and those who have participated directly in conflicts. Secondly, the Bank’s strong local presence and significant resources allow for a speed and level of project response not possible for many development partners. Thirdly, the procedures and project management systems required by the Bank, and the expertise in public expenditure management (PEM) among national Bank staff, are seen to contribute to enhanced transparency in public financial management of peace-related expenditures. Finally, the existing involvement of the Bank in a range of development related sectors relevant to the future integration of conflict-affected populations provides significant potential for downstream linkages between the support under the proposed project and various ongoing and planned developmental activities of the GON.  4. Description The proposed grant would help finance the costs associated with commitments of the Government of Nepal (GON) to post-conflict recovery interventions related to the peace process for identified groups. The proposed support will help respond to the situation by: (i) financing agreed payments and reintegration interventions to selected groups affected by the conflict, including families of those killed as a result of the conflict, conflict-related widows and orphans, and disabled people; (ii) financing agreed periodic payments to Maoists in cantonments in respect of implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Accord; and (iii) capacity building and technical assistance to GON to perform its peace building, reintegration and rehabilitation functions in the post-conflict period.  5. Financing The proposed project size is USD 50 million, equivalent in SDR, to be provided as an IDA grant with 100 percent financing of eligible project expenditures under the Grant. The expected period of implementation is around three years, with the closing date proposed as June 30, 2011.  Source: BORROWER/RECIPIENT IDA Grant Total  ($m.) 0 50 50  6. Implementation Institutional arrangements The institutional arrangements for project implementation would be as follows. At the highest level, it is expected that the PC – once formally established – would act as a high level oversight institution on project activities as part of its broader functions in overseeing the peace process. Pending PC establishment, an interim oversight mechanism would be necessary, most likely under the Steering Committee of the NPTF or such other inclusive mechanism as otherwise agreed with GON. Beneath this, the MOPR would be the primary implementing agency for the project, with the PMT located in the Ministry under the overall supervision of the Commission and the interim oversight mechanism pending its formation. The MOPR has formed a Project Management Team (PMT) headed by the Project Coordinator (Joint Secretary of the Conflict Management Division) and comprised of representatives from other Divisions/Sections – Conflict Analysis and Policy Formulation Division, Relief and Rehabilitation Section, Planning and Monitoring Section and Cantonment Management Division. The Team will include a dedicated Accounts Officer and a part-time Procurement Officer who will pull resources/consultants when required from the system when specific procurement support is required. For Component 1, the PMT will deliver cash benefits through the Cantonment Management Section which  has a Cantonment Officers in each of the seven cantonment sites/districts. For cash payments under Component 2, the PMT will work through the 75 Chief District Officers (CDOs) which are heading the authorized district offices which maintain records of families of people killed as a result of the conflict. A second institutional issue relevant to project implementation is the potential linkages to the NPTF. The NPTF has to date been an off-budget fund since its establishment in 2007. Key development partners have expressed a desire for the Bank under this project to ensure close coordination with the NPTF and explore possibilities for further harmonization once the NPTF comes on budget. Consistent with the Paris Principles of Aid Effectiveness, the Bank, GON and development partners agree that harmonized and coordinated approach is desirable and have been exploring how to operationalize such a relationship while also ensuring compliance with the Bank’s fiduciary requirements. Harmonization of the project and NPTF activities involves several aspects, including harmonization of strategic planning, of the financial management and implementation mechanisms, of reporting and monitoring and of institutional arrangements. The Bank has already initiated discussions with GON and NPTF development partners on how harmonization can be promoted, and there appears to be agreement on modalities. Firstly, mutual sharing of information and plans of the Bank and other development partners will be deepened through the NPTF mechanism in order to ensure complementarity of peace support efforts. This will be particularly important for the project TA and reintegration support activities, where early and sustained discussion of strategic priorities for donor support is essential to avoid duplication of effort. Harmonizing reporting of project and NPTF activities is also possible, and it is proposed to have the project’s financial and performance reports included in the four monthly technical and financial reporting of NPTF. With respect to financial management and funds flow mechanisms, when the NPTF comes on budget, and assuming that the revised NPTF procedures are fully compliant with regular GON budgetary systems, the GON, development partners and the Bank would aim to design a better integrated fund flow system, bringing the two mechanisms more closely in line in the coming fiscal year. There would in any event remain earmarking of Bank funding, given that some eligible activities of the NPTF, e.g. related to elections, are not eligible for Bank financing. Financial Management and Procurement The proposed operation will use the normal government procedures followed by a normal budget line item. The budgeting procedures for preparation, approval, implementation, and monitoring are elaborated in the Financial Procedures Regulations (FPR). The annual work program and budget will be based on the work program to be prepared by the MOPR. Annual work programs and budgets are submitted to the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for discussion. MOF will release authorizations for expenditure to MOPR. The Secretary of MOPR will issue authorization to the Secretary of the Office of Central Coordination for Cantonment Management (OCCCM) for Component 1 and to the Project Coordinator for Components 2 and 3 for disbursement of funds. The Secretary of OCCCM will issue spending authorizations to the Cantonment Officers located in seven districts (Jhapa, Sindhuli, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Rolpa, Surkhet and Kailali) and copy such authorization letters to the MOPR Secretary, the Financial Comptroller General and the District Treasury Controller of seven districts. Fund release to the Cantonment Offices will then take place through a normal release procedure through respective District Treasury Controller Offices (DTCOs). The Secretary of OCCCM will eventually be held accountable for disbursements of funds under Component 1. Similarly, for Component 2, the Project Coordinator would issue spending authorizations to the Chief District Officers (CDOs) of 75 districts and copy such authorization letters to the MOPR Secretary, the Financial Comptroller General and the District Treasurer Controller of 75 districts. Fund release to the CDOs will take place through a normal release procedure through respective DTCOs. The Project Coordinator and CDOs are held accountable for expenses under Component 2.  The Project Management Team has good experience and training in procurement and will have a dedicated procurement officer. The bulk of project financing is for cash transfers, which are not subject to procurement considerations. There is no civil works procurement under this Project. For the goods, training and consultancy services anticipated, packages are not expected to exceed the relevant procurement thresholds which would require complex procurement methods. The limited goods purchased would be done according to national shopping procedures, as the goods are expected to be readily available off the shelf or standard specification commodities. Non-consulting services under the Project will include delivery of seminars and selected training shall be obtained from local service providers through request for proposals using a lump sum format of contract or shopping. Consultancy services will be procured according to national shopping procedures in cases where firms are required to provide the service, and according to Section V of the Consultant Guidelines for selection of individual consultants. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the Consultant Guidelines. Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E): No formal impact evaluation of the Project is proposed, though the project team would conduct periodic monitoring of performance based on the agreed performance indicators, and TA funds are proposed to be allocated for conducting studies during project life to assess the situation of different conflict-affected groups and implementation of project activities. Management Information System (MIS): An effective MIS is a critical management tool to register and monitor the target group beneficiaries, as well as program implementation progress and effectiveness. Furthermore, a solid MIS can provide monitoring data, track utilization of project funds and enhance financial management. TA is provided for under the project to strengthen the MIS of MOPR on peace-related activities of GON and for periodic surveys to monitor progress.  7. Sustainability As an emergency project, there is not as strong an emphasis on sustainability of support as in typical projects. However, the project has components on both capacity building for institutions involved in the peace process and on reintegration support for conflict affected groups which should contribute to the medium term goal of a more sustainable peace (at the societal level) and more sustainable life opportunities (at the household level). 8. Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector The Project has benefited from lessons learned on similar operations in post-conflict settings focusing on supporting peace processes and prepared under OP/BP8.00 procedures. The team drew on Bank-wide expertise and included a member who has worked extensively on similar operations in African postconflict settings. Some of the lessons reflected in design include: (i) keeping project design relatively simple and focused on interventions where national capacity is felt to be adequate; and (ii) application of fiduciary arrangements, particularly with respect to financial management, which reflect lessons of the Nepal portfolio and similar cash payment operations in other countries. This includes reliance on dedicated budget line item for fund transfer, a robust beneficiary identification process preferably with third party involvement in witnessing the payments, and a planned payment process which involves both Government and Maoist input and oversight. Other lessons drawn upon from similar operations include ensuring high-level policy guidance for project activities, allowing sufficient flexibility in project design to adapt to changes in policy and implementation environment, and relying on existing systems and institutions to ensure reasonably rapid execution. Finally, despite the short-term focus of the project, the  project team has also included interventions with a longer term benefit in order to help sustain some of the impacts.  9.

This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors t o provide a grant in an amount o f US$50 million equivalent (SDR 31.3 million) to Nepal for an Emergency Peace Support Project. The Project has been prepared in accordance with OPBP 8.00, Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies. 2. The proposed grant would help finance the costs associated with commitments o f G O N including i t s major coalition partners in the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) - t o post-conflict recovery interventions related t o the peace process for identified groups. The proposed support will help respond t o the situation by: (i)financing agreed payments and reintegration interventions t o selected groups affected by the conflict, including families o f those killed as a financing result o f the conflict, conflict-related widows and orphans, and disabled people; (ii) agreed periodic payments t o individual Maoists in cantonments in respect o f implementation o f the Comprehensive Peace Agreement’; and (iii) capacity building and technical assistance to G O N to perform i t s peace building, reintegration and rehabilitation functions in the post-conflict period. The expected outcomes include contributing to the consolidation o f the Nepal peace 3. improved compliance with the 23 Point Agreement as a result o f timely process by supporting: (i) delivery o f benefit payments to families o f deceased and individual Maoists in cantonments; (ii) improved trust between the parties t o the 23 Point Agreement; (iii) ensuring transparency in implementation o f benefits under the Project for the conflict-affected groups, including the Maoists in cantonments; (iv) development o f a medium term strategy for reintegration and rehabilitation o f conflict-affected populations; and (v) robustly designed and piloted interventions to support reintegration o f conflict-affected populations into social and economic life.  4. Partnership arrangements: While there i s no explicit co-financing for the operation from other agencies, a variety o f agencies are involved in the broader efforts supporting the peace process. This includes support to reintegration o f former combatants who are minors, support to families o f those killed in the conflict and families displaced by the conflict, and related issues such as security force reform. The United Nations agencies include UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNMIN, the European Union (EU) i s providing ongoing support, and bilaterals include the UK Department for International Development (DFID), German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the Governments o f Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and others. In addition, a host o f international and local NGOs are involved in provision o f specific services to the target populations, including Norwegian Refugee Council, International Rescue Committee, and the Save the Children Alliance. The Bank team has benefited from the inputs o f these partners during project preparation (including DFID Peer Review), and has initiated structured coordination through participation in meetings o f the Nepal Peace Trust Fund (NPTF), the key vehicle for bringing together Government and donors to discuss policy, institutional, financing and implementation issues related t o the peace process. The project will be harmonized to the maximum extent possible with the N P T F (see below on Institutional Issues).  As agreed with GON at Negotiations, ‘‘Maoists in cantonment” means those beneficiaries encamped in cantonments, as per the Comprehensive Peace Accord dated November 21,2006, who have subsequently been verified by the United Nations Mission in Nepal through i t s two-stage verification process, and who are eligible for benefits under the Project.  B.  Emergency Challenge: Country Context, Recovery Strategy and Rationale for Proposed Bank Emergency Project  5. Nepal i s one o f the poorest countries in the world, averaging GDP per capita o f US$270 in 2005, with adverse, though in some cases improving, social indicators. Despite this, the country has made substantial progress in poverty reduction in the decade t o 2003104, with the headcount rate falling from 42 to 31 percent. This i s remarkable considering that an armed conflict ran from 1996 t o 2006 which imposed a heavy toll in terms o f human lives: over 14,000 people were killed, many displaced (with estimates over recent years ranging from around 25,000 to around 100,000 people), and others disabled or “disappeared”. As such, unresolved tensions remain in many parts o f the country. 6. In the past t w o years, a fragile peace has been sustained - though not without ongoing unrest and periodic political setbacks - and important steps have been taken towards a “new Nepal”. This includes establishment o f the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) in November 2005 with involvement o f the Maoists, ending o f royal rule in April 2006 and immediate establishment o f an interim SPA Government, signing o f a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government o f Nepal and the Communist Party (CPN-Maoist) in November 2006 and subsequently C P N - M joined government in April 2007, and promulgation o f an interim Constitution in 2007. Elections were held on April 10, 2008 for a Constituent Assembly (CA) which will draft a new Constitution and be the basis for formation o f a new government. The elections were judged by observers t o have been credible, and initial results indicate a strong performance for the CPN-Maoist.* However, final results will not be known for several weeks, and hence the final political composition o f the new Government remains t o be seen. The C A elections had twice been postponed, the second postponement induced by a short-lived Maoist withdrawal from the coalition in late 2007. The Maoists re-entered Government following the signing o f the 23 Point Agreement (23PA) between the members o f the SPA in December 2007. 7. A second set o f developments over the past year has been considerable unrest - including bandhs (strikes, stoppages and blockades), intermittent violence (including killings), disruption o f non-Madhesi political meetings, etc. - in the Tarai region by groups promoting the interests o f M a d h e ~ i s . However, at the end o f February 2008, agreements were signed between GON and ~ major Madhesi political blocs which should help to calm such tensions. These agreements, however, will imply significant financial obligations for the incoming government which will create additional pressure on fiscal resources. 8. N o w that the CA elections have been conducted in a timely and effective manner, the post-electoral period will open up a new set o f challenges to the peace and nation-building processes. While the CPN-Maoist appears set to take over the leadership o f the new Government, both processes will require sustained confidence building between a l l stakeholders. The most 2  The CA will be comprised o f 601 members, o f whom 240 were directly elected on a fmt-past-the-post basis, with a further 335 members elected on the basis o f proportional representation and 26 members appointed by the Council o f Ministers on a consensus basis. International observers who have judged the elections a success include the EU Election Observer Mission, the Asian Network for Free Elections, and the Carter Center. Twenty two districts in the southern plains bordering India make up the Tarai, alternately known as Madhesi. The Tarai occupies 17 percent o f Nepal’s total land area and i s home to nearly 48 percent o f the population, including migrants from the hills. According to official statistics, 3 1.2 percent o f Nepal’s total population i s o f Madhesi origin.  2  immediate will be the composition o f the new Government, for which it remains unclear at this stage what parties would j o i n the CPN-Maoist. Another challenge will be meeting the wideranging commitments t o different population groups which have been made in the recent past. A further key challenge facing Government will be the systematic and substantive review and reform o f the security system - in particular the political challenge o f the proposed integration o f the Maoists in cantonments and the fiscal challenge o f sustaining such integration. 9. These and other challenges will require sustaining the existing level o f confidence among different political parties and deepening it over time in order to consolidate the peace and start the transition from an emphasis on post-conflict to developmental policies. Meeting prior commitments that have financial implications, particularly t o the different groups affected by the conflict, will be critical t o not only bolster this confidence building and transition process; but also, protect the on-going pro-poor expenditures initiated during the Tenth Plan. 10. The 23PA outlines several key agreements between the parties with respect to the ongoing peace process which provide the specific context for the proposed operation. These payment o f outstanding allowances to individual Maoists in cantonments, agreement include: (i) to make future allowance payments, and to engage in further deliberations o n their reintegration following eventual release from cantonments; (ii)commitment to provide compensation provision for rapid release and payments to families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict; (iii) payment o f allowances to those in cantonments who were not verified as eligible by reason o f being under age or having entered cantonment after a prior cut-off date; and (iv) commitment that private and public property seized during the armed conflict will be returned to concerned individuals and agencies. Primary responsibility for implementation o f these commitments rests with the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction (MOPR).  11. The details on the official numbers of, and modalities and levels o f payments to various conflict affected groups have subsequently been outlined in different GON official documents. In the case o f Maoists in cantonments, the Council o f Ministers affirmed a monthly benefit payment o f NRs. 3,000 (around US$48) for the period o f confinement in cantonments? For families o f those killed, the commitments are outlined in a document recently approved by Cabinet.’ The officially endorsed numbers o n different groups are outlined in a GON Task Force report mandated by the Council o f Ministers and that was submitted in March 2008. 12. The institutional architecture in GON for dealing with different aspects o f the peace and reconstruction process i s summarized in the 23PA. There i s commitment to formation o f several high level Commissions tasked with guiding different aspects o f the peace process. A key institution in this respect i s the High Level Peace Commission (PC), intended to be a body with cross-party representation which acts as the policy and oversight bodya6 It i s required to coordinate closely with the MOPR. Pending formation o f the PC, GON approved shortly prior t o elections a Peace and Conflict Management Committee with high level c i v i l society participation. Apart from governmental institutions, a range o f UN, international and national agencies are supporting different aspects o f the peace process. The coordinating UN agency i s the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN), a special political mission established by the UN Security See Letter o f Chief Secretary, dated October 7,2007. See Norms for Financial Support and Relief o f Conflict Victims. In addition to the Peace Commission, other relevant institutions mandated in the 23 Point Agreement are: (i) Truth and Reconciliation Commission; (ii) Commission for the Investigation o f the Disappeared; (iii) High level Committee for Monitoring the Effective Implementation o f the CPA and other Agreements; and (iv) State Restructuring Commission.  3  Council to support the peace process in Nepal and in particular to assist in the conduct o f the C A election in a free and fair atmosphere. UNMIN officially began i t s work in January 2007, and i t s current mandate runs to mid-July 2008.  13. Given the range o f UN and bilateral players involved in supporting the peace process, the proposed project has been designed taking into account existing and planned support to the G O N from other development partners. The key coordinating mechanisms and funding vehicles for donors involved in supporting the peace process are: (i) Nepal Peace Trust Fund (NPTF) the administered by Ministry o f Finance (MOF) and technically supported by MOPR; and (ii) UN the Peace Trust Fund for Nepal, administered by the UN and focused o n activities which the Government i t s e l f i s not able to implement. Both trust funds (TFs) are overseen by a Joint Steering Committee. Consultations between the project team and the NPTF group have helped to ensure that the project interventions will avoid duplication o f effort and institutional structures, but are also complementary in areas where Bank support i s considered useful to leverage greater impact o f the efforts o f various development partners. 14. The rationale for Bank involvement has several elements in light o f the request from G O N for urgent support. The f i r s t i s that the Bank has considerable international experience in providing support to peace processes, specifically dealing with conflict-affected populations and those who have participated directly in conflicts. Secondly, the Bank’s strong local presence and significant resources allow for a speed and level o f project response not possible for many development partners. Thirdly, the procedures and project management systems required by the Bank, and the expertise in public expenditure management (PEM) among national Bank staff, are seen to contribute to enhanced transparency in public financial management o f peace-related expenditures. Finally, the existing involvement o f the Bank in a range o f development related sectors relevant to the future integration o f conflict-affected populations provides significant potential for downstream linkages between the support under the proposed project and various ongoing and planned developmental activities o f the GON.  C.  Bank Response and Strategy  Brief description o f Bank’s strategy o f emergency support 15. The Bank’s post-conflict transition support strategy for Nepal i s outlined in the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) discussed at the Board in February 2007.’ It i s framed around three possible country scenarios - “stalled transition” where stability holds but development i s very difficult; “steady transition” where both peace and development are pursued without significant reversals; and “deterioration scenario”, where the political process fails and the state struggles t o maintain basic functions. The key themedfocus areas to support the post-conflict transition outlined in the I S N are: (i) protecting the reforms already undertaken in selected areas, including in the education sector, in PFM, and in promoting inclusion through community-based projects and policy work; and (ii) supporting a post-conflict economic program (and eventually a new Poverty Reduction and Development Strategy), including state building, promoting partnerships between public and private/community sectors, improving governance and promoting inclusive development. The I S N also envisages possibly supporting the transition t o a more stable political environment through measures such as support to victims o f the conflict if considered important to support the peace process and/or protect developmental expenditures.  ’IDA Interim Strategy Note for Nepal, January 22,2007. 4  Report No. 381 19-NEP.  Project Development Objectives 16. The proposed project comes at a critical juncture in Nepal’s history and i s considered to have an important role in contributing to consolidation o f the peace process and the democratic transition. The rapid and early commitment to Bank financing o f commitments under the 23PA also acted as confidence building measure between major parties in the run-up to elections. The overall objective o f the project i s t o contribute to the consolidation o f the peace process in Nepal by supporting: (i) Government t o meet commitments to people affected by the conflict, including families o f the deceased, orphans, widows and disabled people, and Maoists in cantonments; (ii) ensuring transparency in implementation o f benefits under the Project for the conflict-affected groups including the Maoists in cantonments; and (iii) strengthening o f key institutions which are tasked with policy and implementation functions in peace building, reintegration and rehabilitation.  Summary o f Project Components (see Annex 1 also) 17.  The project would consist o f three components:  Transitional safety net payments to Maoists in cantonments during the transition period (US$18.55 million). Over 19,000 eligible Maoists have been placed in twenty-eight cantonments (seven central sites and twenty one satellites) following the Peace Accord, with commitment by political parties to payment o f regular allowances t o reduce the chances o f disenchantment and t o mitigate against a need for rent-seeking behavior while the Maoists are encamped. These act in effect as transitional safety net payments. However, 10 months o f payments were outstanding as o f mid-April 2008, and there are presently no funds budgeted for forward payments that will be necessary for the months following elections. This component would finance transitional safety net payments for 19,602 Maoists in cantonments. The eligible Maoists were registered and verified by a two-stage process involving the two parties t o the conflict and UNMIN, which conducted a detailed verification o f each potential beneficiary and issued individual bar-coded identity cards t o those verified. The verification and registration process i s considered t o have followed good international practice by Bank and UN staff familiar with similar operations in other countries. The component would cover both payment arrears from July 2007 and forward payments for the period to mid-January 2009 for those registered through this process.8 Arrears would be paid on a one-off basis and forward payments on a regular periodic basis. The benefits would be paid out to the individual beneficiaries in the form o f individual checks for the initial payments, with an effort to move to bank account deposits as the payment modality before the end o f the project-financed period o f benefit^.^ The payment process would involve administrative officials, Maoists representatives and an agreed independent third party to witness the payments. Periodic payments would be made according t o an agreed set o f guidelines which are intended to ensure transparency in the process, and compliance with the guidelines would be a condition o f disbursement o f project funds for payments. Project financing would be provided on a reimbursement basis, providing an additional check on compliance with the agreed procedures. There would also be financing under Component 3 8  T h e breakdown o f the 19,602 is: (i) 18,789 h l l y verified Maoists in cantonments; (ii) Maoists eligible 153 but not in cantonment as providing VIP security services; and (iii) Maoists in cantonments from Phase 660 I1 verification also awaiting final decisions but eligible. For the latter two groups arrears are owed from November 2006. The payment method contrasts with the one round o f payments made in 2007, where a lump-sum payment was made to the Maoist camp commanders for subsequent distribution to those in the cantonment.  5  for a communications campaign to inform beneficiaries o f their entitlements and the payment process, as well as surveys o f beneficiaries initiated as soon as possible after payments begin to be made. Finally, GON and the Bank would need to agree, as part o f the payment guidelines, on a grievance redressal mechanism for beneficiaries in the event o f irregularities in the payment process. While the ultimate period o f future residence in cantonments i s not known at this point, a cut-off date has been agreed with GON which balances estimates o f future need with the need for an exit strategy for the Bank. Benefit payments beyond January 2009 would be expected to be picked up within the budget through a proposal o f supplementary budget if required. In addition to the financing o f transitional safety net payments, there would be provision for incremental operating costs associated with delivery o f benefits in a manner consistent with the Bank and GON's fiduciary standards (e.g., logistical costs o f physical delivery o f payments). Assuming payment o f arrears and an additional nine months o f payments, post-elections, the estimated value o f this component i s US$18.55 million, o f which US$550,000 would be for incremental operating costs.  Benefits to families o those killed as a result o the conflict and reintegration support to f f other conflict-afSected populations (UU28.23 million). This component would have two sub-components. The first component would finance benefit payments t o survivor families o f people killed as a result o f the conflict. Therefore, this component would provide compensation payments t o 14,000 plus families in the amount o f NRs. 100,000 (US$1570) per person killed as per GON decision in March 2008. This would be paid as a lump sum, though payments would in practice be spread over several months to achieve national coverage. These families were identified through a process conducted under the leadership o f Chief District Officers (CDOs), with input from several sources to verify eligible families and with close review by higher levels o f administration and Government. This process i s therefore considered t o have done a reliable j o b o f identification by national and international observers o f the process, including identifying the eligible individual in the families o f those killed who would be entitled to receive the payment." Given the significant lump sum amount o f the benefit, payments would be required t o be made into bank accounts o f individual beneficiaries in order to reduce risks. There would also be a set o f guidelines agreed for the payment process which would be required to be followed as a condition o f disbursement o f project funds for payments. This would include a role for local third parties who could advise beneficiaries both during the payment process and subsequently on options for use o f the funds. As with first component, there would be provision for incremental operating costs associated with delivery o f benefits in a manner consistent with the Bank and GON's fiduciary standards. There would also be linked support under Component 3 for a communications campaign to beneficiaries, special external reviews o f the payment process and beneficiary surveys which would be implemented from early in the process t o gain insights into the effectiveness o f the payment procedures and adjust them as necessary for other districts where payments are made later. There would also need to be a grievance process agreed as part o f the payment process guidelines. The estimated size o f the payments and recurrent cost support under the first sub-component i s US$23.23 million, o f which around US$45 5,000 would be for incremental operating costs. The second sub-component would provide support for reintegration assistance to other conflict-affected groups (including, inter alia, people disabled in the conflict; internally lo Confidence in the official number o f families with a member killed as a result o f the conflict i s bolstered by the fact that a national NGO (INSEC) conducted detailed information collection throughout the conflict on those killed through a network o f local investigators. Their figures on the number o f people killed as a result o f the conflict and their composition are remarkably close to the official numbers.  6  displaced people (IDPs); families o f persons who have disappeared; minors involved in the conflict; orphaned children; widows). This could take a variety o f forms (e.g., training; legal and counseling services; rehabilitation services for disabled people; piloting o f interventions) and would be elaborated by GON with the assistance o f technical assistance (TA) provided under the third component and in close consultation with other development partners through the mechanism o f the Nepal Peace Trust Fund. Given the uncertainty on the specific reintegration assistance and i t s scale, the team proposes that a dedicated pool be provided in the project to finance reintegration support for selected conflict-affected groups. This would be more specifically defined and programmed during the first year o f project implementation, including through pilot activities, and closely coordinated to maximize complementarity with the activities o f GON and the development partners. This would be consolidated into operational guidelines for accessing these funds which would be a condition o f disbursement for the sub-component, an approach used previously in Nepal under the Economic Reform Technical Assistance (ERTA) Project. I t i s not expected that the funds proposed would be sufficient to cover the likely overall reintegration support needs o f these groups. However, as the policy framework i s elaborated by GON, additional resources could be made available through either reallocation o f existing funds or seeking supplemental financing as appropriate. The proposed amount for reintegration support interventions would be US$Smillion. 0  Capacity building o key institutional structures in support o the peace process and project f f management support (US$3.22 million). This component would have three sub-components: (i) capacity building and technical assistance for the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction to perform their core functions more effectively. This would include as an immediate priority i t s oversight role on payments to families o f deceased and Maoists in cantonments (e.g., strengthening the M I S system, internal procedures, communications campaigns for beneficiaries o f project-financed payments, and monitoringheporting, including beneficiary surveys), and programs for other conflict-affected groups such as orphans, widows, and disabled people. In addition, it would include technical assistance and capacity building for performance o f the Ministry’s roles in supporting the peace process, within an overall vision o f the Ministry as a coordinator rather than executor. This would include training, legal advisory support for i t s secretariat functions in drafting new policies and procedural guidelines, advisory services on development o f GON’s overall reintegration strategy and specific reintegration interventions programs, and capacity for information education campaigns (IEC) which are considered a critical element in building awareness and confidence in the overall peace process. The component would promote exposure to best international practices in reintegration, reconciliation and rehabilitation, devising appropriate mechanisms for integrating peace and developmental activities, reorienting sectoral ministries towards conflict-sensitive design o f development projects, and supporting effective functioning o f the peace focal points in each ministry. The technical assistance under this component would inform design o f the reintegration support activities for various groups to be financed under Component 2. I t will be critical to ensure that more specific definition o f TA support i s done in close coordination with other development partners, several o f which have or plan for support t o peace and reintegration activities. The proposed vehicle for ensuring such harmonization o f approach i s the NPTF, pending formation o f the Peace support Commission or agreement on such subsequent politically inclusive mechanism; (ii) for core project implementation tasks o f the Project Management Team (PMT) such as procurement, financial management (FM), including evaluation o f project interventions training, workshops and technical through surveys and other assessment tools; and (iii) assistance for other actors in the peace process as needed, including the Peace Commission once formed, the Peace and Conflict Management Committee if required, Local Peace  7  Committees, and other groups such as parliamentarians and possibly other bodies related to the peace process envisaged in the 23PA.l’ Given the relatively short project implementation period and nature o f interventions, this component i s estimated to cost US$3.22 million.  Eligibility for Processing under OPBP 8.00  18. The application o f O P B P 8.00 i s justified for this operation due t o the project’s nature as well as the need for a rapid and flexible response. Consistent with BP 8.00, the project would explicitly help to: (i) facilitate peace building (paragraph 4.e); and (ii) establish and/or preserve human, institutional, and/or social capital, including economic reintegration o f vulnerable groups (paragraph 4.d). The use o f streamlined procedures allowed for under OPBP 8.00 has helped to ensure timely processing o f the operation in direct support o f the immediate needs o f Government which had sought a clear commitment from the Bank prior to the elections, and rapid start-up o f project activities following elections. In light o f this, and given uncertainties around some o f the activities which may impact the operation (particularly integration o f the Maoists in cantonments), the OPBP’s emphasis on ex-post controls and more intensive supervision to facilitate adjustments t o implementation realities as appropriate i s also particularly relevant. The Bank considered other options such as general budgetary support, but the importance o f robust fiduciary standards in use o f the funds suggested that a Rapid Response (RR) investment operation (RR) was a more appropriate instrument. An additional important feature o f such operations i s the flexibility allowed for under O P B P 8.00 t o adapt elements o f the project to an evolving institutional and policy situation such as one sees in Nepal presently. N o existing or well-developed pipeline projects easily lend themselves to restructuring or redesign given the size and importance o f the cash transfer component proposed under this operation. The task team anticipates that down-stream linkages with the ongoing Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF, a CDDtype operation) would be explored for medium-term support to populations and communities affected by the conflict. The Government welcomes the involvement o f a third party financier in terms o f providing assurance on the credibility o f payment and as a second channel for reviewing the payment process to ensure transparency and that payments reach the intended beneficiaries. Consistency with Country Strategy  19. As noted above, the proposed operation i s consistent with the 2007 Nepal ISN, which emphasizes both the need for ensuring sustained support for peace building efforts and also the need to remain flexible to a fluid transitional environment in the country. Particular importance i s attached to rapid response t o help reinforce the nascent peace in order t o capitalize on Nepal’s window for laying the ground for sustained peace and development. The I S N clearly notes the importance o f short term support and confidence building measures to increase the chances o f Nepal progressing to a steady and sustained transition scenario. M o r e specifically, the I S N anticipates the possibility o f providing financial support for immediate needs during the peace process, including immediate relief to victims o f the conflict, in order to avoid crowding out o f much needed development spending.  11  The 23 Point Agreement foresees the formation o f a set o f high level bodies which would help carry the peace process forward. Apart from the Peace Commission, these include the Commission for the Investigation o f the Disappeared, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, State Restructuring Commission, Study and Recommendation Commission for Scientific Land Reform, and the High Level Committee for Monitoring the Effective Implementation o f the CPA and Other Agreements. See Text o f 23PA, dated December 23, 2007.  8  Expected Outcomes and Indicators  20. Project outcomes: The following outcomes are anticipated from the project: (i) improved compliance with the 23PA as a result o f timely delivery o f cash payments to people affected by the conflict, including families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict (including improved trust between parties to the 23 widows and orphans) and Maoists in cantonments; (ii) increased transparency in the payments process with respect to payments Point Agreement; (iii) due to people affected by the conflict, including families o f deceased, disabled people, widows and orphans and Maoists in cantonments; (iv) development o f a medium term strategy for reintegration o f conflict-affected populations; and (v) robustly designed and piloted interventions to support reintegration o f conflict-affected populations into economic activity. 21. Outcome Indicators: The following indicators would be used t o monitor the achievement o f the above outcomes: (i) proportion o f eligible Maoists in cantonments and regular and families o f deceased receiving timely due payments on an individual basis; (ii) effective coordination between the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction and other relevant acceptable audit reports on payments and agencies at the central and district levels; (iii) compliance with agreed payment procedures; (iv) medium term strategy for economic reintegration o f selected conflict-affected populations; and (v) inclusion o f selected conflictaffected populations in programs providing support for reintegration. See Annex 2 (Results and Monitoring Framework) for more details.  D.  Appraisal o f Project Activities  Economic Aspects: The overarching economic justification for the operation i s that it 22. will contribute t o confidence building in the peace process, contributing in turn to an environment which i s more conducive to the economic development o f Nepal. At the same time, it i s important to recognize that many other factors will feed into the attainment o f sustainable peace and development. Thus, while a suitable accommodation with Maoists and other conflictaffected groups i s a necessary condition o f peace building, it i s not sufficient. However, by explicitly involving the Bank as an actor supporting the peace process, it i s hoped that the operation will also give the institution a more complete scope o f involvement in Nepal’s development. More specifically, the TA and capacity building in support o f peace building and reconstruction should contribute over time to a policy and institutional environment which promotes social and economic reintegration o f conflict-affected groups, increasing initially their ability to support themselves and in time contribute more actively to economic activity in the country. Institutional Issues: A key institutional issue relevant to the design and effective 23. implementation o f the project i s the political inclusiveness o f institutions which will be responsible for moving the peace process forward. The political representativeness o f these institutions will have a direct impact on the acceptability o f the project to different actors. The Peace Commission (PC) i s anticipated by the 23PA as a key high level and politically inclusive body to guide the peace process. Terms o f reference (TORS) for the PC were endorsed by the Council o f Ministers in March 2008. I t i s expected that the PC will be formally established after elections, though the precise timing remains unclear at this point. Pending formation o f the PC, the Bank, GON and development partners have discussed a multi-party mechanism for providing oversight and guidance t o the project and peace process activities more broadly. Such a multiparty mechanism i s considered crucial by all actors in promoting buy-in by different political players to activities in support o f the peace process, including the project. It i s also considered  9  important that such a politically inclusive oversight and policy body for the project be the same as that relied on by other development partners supporting the peace process in order to promote harmonization. Pending future developments, it has been agreed that the Steering Committee for the NPTF, which involves multi-party representation would be the oversight body for the operation. This arrangement would be discussed with the new Government in the nearest future, and there may be subsequent options agreed by the new Government, the Bank and development partners. Whatever the decision on the eventual oversight and policy body beyond the NPTF SC, GON, development partners and the Bank would continue t o coordinate closely t o ensure that the multi-party oversight mechanism for the project i s one that has support o f all actors and promotes close coordination o f effort and harmonization between the efforts o f Government and donors. After the interim period, establishing and operationalizing an institutional relationship that has the PC as the key policy and oversight body in the peace process with the Ministry as in effect i t s executing secretariat i s one possible model. The flexibility allowed for under OPBP 8.00 will be useful to allow the oversight arrangements for the project t o respond t o the evolving scenario in the coming weeks and months. In addition to the planned national level Peace Commission, district level Local Peace Committees (LPCs), with representation from the administration, local political parties, and civil society, have been or are expected t o be constituted to take the peace process to the grassroots level. Up till April 2008, 24 such LPCs had been established (out o f a required total o f 75 - one per district), though their full effectiveness will require both establishment o f the Peace Commission and capacity building. 24. A second institutional issue relevant to project implementation i s the linkages to the NPTF, formed in 2007. The N P T F was until recently an off-budget fund for the donor portion, though donors have recently discussed with GON modalities to bring it on budget. The implications o f this move for FM procedures and funds f l o w are in the process o f being defined. K e y development partners have expressed a desire for the Bank under this project to ensure close coordination with the NPTF and maximum harmonization with the NPTF activities and institutional arrangements. Consistent with the Paris Principles o f Aid Effectiveness, the Bank, GON and development partners agree that harmonized and coordinated approach i s desirable and have been exploring how to operationalize such a relationship while also ensuring compliance with the Bank’s fiduciary requirements. 25. Harmonization o f the project and NPTF activities involves several aspects, including harmonization o f strategic planning, o f the financial management and implementation mechanisms, o f reporting, recording and monitoring and o f institutional arrangements. The Bank has had intensive initial discussions with GON and NPTF development partners on how harmonization can be promoted, and there appears to be agreement on modalities. Firstly, mutual sharing o f information and plans o f the Bank and other development partners will be deepened through the NPTF mechanism in order to ensure complementarity o f peace support efforts. This will be particularly important for the project TA and reintegration support activities, where early and sustained discussion o f strategic priorities for donor support i s essential to avoid duplication o f effort. In order to ensure this, it i s proposed that the Project Management Team share TOR for consultancy assignments over an agreed threshold with the Technical Committee o f the NPTF and seek i t s comments and suggestions prior to procurement o f the consultancy services. Harmonizing reporting o f project and NPTF activities would also be desirable, and it i s proposed to have the project’s financial and performance reports included in the four monthly technical and financial reporting o f NPTF. With respect to financial management and funds flow mechanisms, when the NPTF comes o n budget, and assuming that the revised NPTF procedures are fully compliant with regular GON budgetary systems, the GON, development partners and the Bank would aim t o align the fund f l o w system in the coming Nepali fiscal year for project-financed activities under Component 2 B (for reintegration support) and Component 3 (for capacity  10  building). There would in any event remain earmarking of Bank funding (as allowed for under NPTF procedures), given that some eligible activities o f the NPTF, e.g., related to security force reform, are not eligible for Bank financing. With respect to the cash payment support under Component 1 and 2A, these would be subject to the agreed guidelines and procedures which would ensure maximum transparency and accountability, ensuring that all payments go to the intended individual beneficiaries.  26. On the narrower issue of project implementation arrangements, it has been agreed with GON that the Project Management Team be located in the MOPR, with regular staff from relevant departments, including the cantonment management unit which sits in MOPR but reports to MOF. The PMT would thus be integrated into regular governmental operations, in contrast to a traditional PCU. An important issue for discussion i s putting in place reporting arrangements from the PMT to both the Ministry and the PC - or the interim multi-party oversight mechanism pending establishment of the PC - which ensure that oversight o f project implementationi s done in a politically inclusive manner. The vehicle for oversight beyond MOPR, pending the establishment o f the PC, would be the Steering Committee o f NPTF or such subsequent politically inclusive oversight and policy making body as agreed with the new Government. At the technical level, the PMT would coordinate with the Technical Committee o f the NPTF as noted above in order to ensure that project-financed activities for reintegration and capacity building benefit from the Technical Committee’s expertise and to promote coherence o f technical support under the project, from GON and from development partners. 27. Lessons o f Experience: The project has benefited from lessons learned on similar operations in post-conflict settings focusing on supporting peace processes and prepared under OPA3P8.00 procedures. The team drew on Bank-wide expertise and included a member who has worked extensively on similar operations in African post-conflict settings. Some of the lessons reflected in design include: (i)keeping project design relatively simple and focused on application of fiduciary interventions where national capacity i s felt to be adequate; and (ii) arrangements, particularly with respect to FM, which reflect lessons of the Nepal portfolio and similar cash payment operations in other countries. This includes reliance on a dedicated budget line item for fund transfer, a robust beneficiary identification process; and a planned payment process which involves both Government and Maoist input and oversight. Other lessons drawn upon from similar operations include ensuring high-level policy guidance for project activities including seeking harmonizationof donor approaches to support for the peace process - allowing sufficient flexibility in project design to adapt to changes in policy and implementation environment, and relying on existing systems and institutions to ensure reasonably rapid execution. Finally, despite the short-term focus of the project, the project team has also included interventions with a longer term benefit in order to help sustain some of the impacts. 28. Safeguards and Environmental Issues: The proposed environmental category for the project i s “C”, reflecting the nature o f proposed interventions (cash payments; provision o f consultancy services and training; office equipment), which are not expected to have adverse environmental impacts. N o safeguards policies are triggered, as summarized in the ISDS which has been reviewed and approved by the regional safeguards team. 29. The project has been prepared in line with OP/BP 8.00 and does not involve any exceptions to Bank policies.  11  E. Implementation Arrangements and FinancingPlan  30. Institutional Arrangements for Project Implementation: The institutional arrangements for project implementation would be as follows. At the highest level, it i s expected that the PC - once formally established - would act as a high-level oversight and policy-making institution on project activities as part o f i t s broader functions in overseeing the peace process. Pending PC establishment, an interim oversight mechanism under the Steering Committee o f the NPTF would be used, subject to any further agreement with GON and development partners on an alternative politically inclusive oversight mechanism (see above). Beneath this, the M O P R would be the primary implementing agency for the project, with the PMT located in the Ministry under the overall supervision o f the Commission and the interim oversight mechanism pending i t s formation. The M O P R has formed a Project Management Team (PMT) headed by the Project Coordinator (Joint Secretary o f the Conflict Management Division) and comprised o f representatives from other Divisions/Sections - Conflict Analysis and Policy Formulation Division, Relief and Rehabilitation Section, Planning and Monitoring Section and Cantonment Management Division. The Team will include a dedicated Accounts Officer and a part-time Procurement Officer who will pull resources/consultants when required from the system when specific procurement support i s required. For Component 1, the PMT will deliver cash benefits through the Cantonment Management Section which has Cantonment Officers in each o f the main cantonment siteddistricts. For cash payments under Component 2, the P M T will work through the 75 Chief District Officers (CDOs) which are heading the authorized district offices that maintain records o f families o f people killed as a result o f the conflict. 3 1. The proposed operation will use the normal government procedures followed by a normal budget line item, with such additional checks and balances as agreed under the payment guidelines for payments t o individual Maoists in cantonments and families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict. The budgeting procedures for preparation, approval, implementation, and monitoring are elaborated in the Financial Procedures Regulations (FPR). The annual work program and budget will be based on the work program to be prepared by the MOPR. Annual work programs and budgets are submitted to the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) for discussion. 32. MOF will release authorizations for expenditure to MOPR. The Secretary o f M O P R will issue authorization to the Secretary o f the Office o f Central Coordination for Cantonment Management (OCCCM) for Component 1 and to the Project Coordinator for Components 2 and 3 for disbursement o f funds. The Secretary o f O C C C M will issue spending authorizations to the Cantonment Officers located in seven districts (Jhapa, Sindhuli, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Rolpa, Surkhet and Kailali) and copy such authorization letters to the MOPR Secretary, the Financial Comptroller General and the District Treasury Controller o f seven districts. Fund release to the Cantonment Offices will then take place through a normal release procedure through respective District Treasury Controller Offices (DTCOs). The Secretary o f OCCCM will eventually be held accountable for disbursements o f funds under Component 1. Similarly, for Component 2A, the Project Coordinator would issue spending authorizations to the Chief District Officers (CDOs) o f 75 districts and copy such authorization letters to the MOPR Secretary, the Financial Comptroller General and the District Treasurer Controller o f 75 districts. Fund release t o the CDOs will take place through a normal release procedure through respective DTCOs. The Project Coordinator and CDOs are held accountable for expenses under Component 2.  33. Once the funds are released to the Cantonment Officers in the seven districts through the respective DTCOs for Component 1 (payments to individual Maoists in cantonments), a modification in the current system i s warranted in order to ensure that cash transfers take place to  12  the intended beneficiaries. Transactions would be made only through checks in the name of individual beneficiaries as per the approved l i s t of eligible Maoists in cantonments by using the services of banks with a network in the cantonment locations. Checks would not be transferred unless a GON representative from the cantonment management office and Maoist representative certify the eligibility o f payments as per the agreed norms. I t would also be required that an independent third party witness the payment process, and arrangement be made to that effect with the involvement o f the Maoists and GON which i s also acceptable to IDA. Such an arrangement would need to elaborate the scope o f the third party's role in "witnessing the payments" which ensures a standard process for the role of the third party witness. Documents based on which checks would be issued are the approved Attendance Roster, vouchers generated for payments to each individual and checks prepared based on such approved vouchers. Where feasible, beneficiaries will be encouraged to open individual savings accounts so that payments can be made directly to their savings accounts. GON has entered into dialogue with the government owned banks to facilitate the process. Arrangements will be made for mobile banks to provide services in a specified date in each cantonment. Maoists in cantonments would encash their checks through mobile banking. Banks will check the identity o f each individual, verify the check, and obtain receipts o f checks and payments from each individual. For Component 2A (payments to families o f deceased people), the Chief District Officer (CDO) will be accountable to verify and attest the receipt o f payments made to the identified beneficiaries. One-off cash transfers in this case will also be made through banking arrangements through checks, preferably, in the individual savings accounts if not, through demand checks. As mandated by the Interim Constitution of Nepal, Project Audits would be carried out 34. by the Supreme Audit Institution, the Office o f the Auditor General. 35. Project costs and financing plan: Total project costs are estimated at US$50 million. The breakdown o f by expenditure category would be as outlined in the table below.  Expenditure category  Estimated US$ Allocation  Goods  200,000  Cash Payments  40,800,000  Consulting services, Training  2,800,000  Reintegration Support  5,000,000  Incremental Operating Costs  1,200,000 50,000,000  Total  37. Disbursement arrangements: Disbursements from IDA will be made in accordance with traditional disbursement procedures, including full documentation for contracts above the  13  Prior Review threshold or Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs). T o facilitate disbursements, a Designated Account in Nepali Rupees will be established. For all payments, including cash transfers, GON will pre-fund the activities, and disbursements from IDA will be made via replenishments o f the Designated Account. For payments in foreign currency under Component 3, if any, would be made through request for direct payments by IDA t o the concerned party. 38. Retroactive Financing: T o facilitate speedy support t o Maoists in cantonments prior to project effectiveness, the Project would allow retroactive financing in the amount o f US$20 million (up to 40 percent o f the IDA grant amount) for benefit transfers that occurred after July 2007 and have followed the disbursement/FM procedures agreed under this project to ensure eligibility o f expenditures.  39. Use of Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs): SOEs will be used for the following expenditures: (i) cash transfers under components 1 and 2; (ii) training, workshop and study all all tours; and (iv) all incremental operating costs; (v) contracts for equipment and vehicles, costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract; (vi) contracts for services o f consulting f i r m s costing less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract; and (vii) contracts for services o f individual consultants costing less than US$25,000 equivalent per contract. During the initial IDA supervision, the mission will closely review the SOE claims to ensure that the funds are utilized for the intended purposes. Any ineligible expenditure identified during this and subsequent reviews will need t o be refunded to IDA. 40. Designated Accounts: A separate Designated Account in Nepali Rupees will be established, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The authorized allocations for the Designated Account under the Grant will be NRs. 300,000,000. For the utilization o f IDA’S share o f project expenditures, the PMT in MOPR may open and maintain the Designated Accounts in Nepali Rupees at the Nepal Rastra Bank under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The Designated Accounts will be managed under the joint signatures o f the Project Coordinator and the Accounts Officer.  41. Procurement: The P M T Project Coordinator has good experience and training in procurement. An additional procurement resource person will be pulled in o n consultancy or on deputation terms as and when the procurement function requires substantial inputs. In general, however, the project activities are not expected to involve complex procurement, i.e. the bulk o f project financing i s for cash transfers, which are not subject t o procurement considerations. There i s no civil works procurement under this Project. For the anticipated goods, training and consultancy services anticipated, the packages are not expected t o exceed the relevant procurement thresholds which would require more complex procurement methods. The limited goods purchased would be done according to national shopping procedures, as the goods are expected to be readily available o f f the shelf or standard specification commodities. Request for Quotation documents will be satisfactory to and agreed with the Bank. Non-consulting services under the project will include delivery o f seminars and selected training shall be obtained from local service providers through request for proposals using a lump sum format o f contract or shopping. Consultancy services will be procured according t o national shopping procedures in cases where f i r m s are required t o provide the service, and according to Section V o f the Consultant Guidelines for selection o f individual consultants. Short l i s t s o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$ 200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines. Further details on procurement thresholds for different activities and review procedures are outlined in Annex 5.  14  42. Arrangements for Bank supervision, monitoring, and evaluation: Bank supervision would be done on a continuous basis out o f the Bank’s Nepal Country Office, where the co-task team leader (TTL), FM specialist and operations analyst (a consultant) are located. In addition, formal regular supervision missions would be conducted initially o n a quarterly basis and subsequently as needed (but n o less than twice a year). The other co-TTL and procurement staff are located in the Bank’s N e w Delhi office and are thus accessible for both regular and formal supervision as required. An ex-post review o f cash transfers will also be carried out by using the qualified consulting firm. Through the capacity building component, studies will also be undertaken o f the cash payment process in order to assess the robustness and propose modifications as needed. 43. Given the very short preparation period o f the project, supervision demands in the initial 6-12 months o f project implementation can be expected to be intensive. This i s typical o f OP 8.00 operations where quality assurance i s unusually dependent o n supervision ex post, and where the inherent uncertainty o f the situation requires close supervision t o allow the project to respond to an evolving situation. In addition, the need to elaborate the packages o f reintegration support interventions for different conflict-affected populations will require close involvement o f team members as well as close coordination with the other development partners providing assistance to the peace process. This will therefore need to be taken this account in allocation o f supervision budget for the project, especially for the forthcoming fiscal year.  With respect to evaluation, there would be periodic monitoring o f performance based on 44. the agreed performance indicators outlined in Annex 2, and TA funds are proposed to be allocated for conducting studies during project life to assess the situation o f different conflictaffected groups. This would include household and local area surveys, qualitative studies on perceptions o f reintegration among different groups, and other methods to be agreed in the initial months o f project implementation. Illustrative implementation schedule. The proposed closing date for the project i s June 45. 30, 201 1. The estimated implementation schedule i s as follows: (i) Board approval, late-April, 2008; (ii) Project Effectiveness, June 2008 (iii) Initial formal supervision mission, June 2008; and (iv) Project Closing in June 201 1. Given the likely scheduling o f cash payments, it i s expected that the large majority o f disbursements would take place in the first 6-12 months o f project life.  F.  Project Risks and Mitigating Measures  46. The project has a number o f risks that could undermine the achievement o f i t s development objectives (DOs). Overall, and inherent in the post-conflict situation, the risks o f the project not achieving i t s objectives fully or sustainably are high. Even with the proposed mitigation measures, the residual risks remain significant in some cases, and the project can therefore be considered a “high risk, high reward” operation. Even if the project i s well implemented and project-specific risks are well managed, broader political and social risks could undermine achievement o f the objectives and can not be fully mitigated within the project itself. The key risks and proposed mitigating measures are outlined below:  15  Risk  Mitigating measures  Political risks * Breakdown in the.democratic transition process and key players cease to abide by the 23PA  Larger risk which the project can not properly mitigate, but project support for meeting financial commitments o f peace process acts as confidence building measure  Implementation risks Cash benefits are not paid i a manner n consistent with required fiduciary, particularly FM, procedures  Well-defined fiduciaryFM arrangements, with third party involvement in payment process and intensive monitoring by IDA Agree cut-off date with GON for I D A financing o f payments and on budgetary procedures for financing allowance payments beyond project allocation. Composition o f PC i s sufficiently representative with high-level membership. TA for capacity strengthening o f PC and MOPR. Disbursements linked to effective PC oversight.  Uncertainty on future period of residence in cantonments results i unclear exit strategy for n Bank in financing allowances PC or other multi-party oversight body unable to exercise effective cross-party oversight o f project and other peace support expenditures  TA to deepen engagement with GON on developing options for successful reintegration o f different groups. On Maoists in cantonments, continuation o f GON Committee on security force reform with support o f other UN agencies and bilaterals.  Uncertainty on reintegration options for conflict-affected target groups undermines sustainability o f beneficiary transitions  Reput at ional risks Bank viewed as not being politically evenhanded under project in balancing support to various specific conflict-affected groups  Providing support to both Maoist and nonMaoist victims o f the conflict as well as providing institutional support to GON. Engagement with multi-party PC or equivalent interim body to ensure ongoing buy-in across the political spectrum Regular monitoring o f project implementation and use o f individual check payments. Periodic monitoring surveys and other assessment tools.  Cash benefits partly accrue to Maoists and Bank i s viewed as providing support to Maoist party instead o f to individual Maoists in cantonments  G.  Terms and Conditions for Project Financing  47.  The Project will be financed entirely through IDA grant, as have been a l l recent projects approved for Nepal. Financing o f project costs would be done o n a 100 percent basis.  48. Prior to disbursement, it would be essential to have three actions finalized, which are essential to ensuring that the payments made under Components 1 and 2 (1) are delivered in a manner which satisfies fiduciary standards and reflects a political and institutional commitment among the respective actors to robust payment processes f o r both Maoists in cantonments and families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict. In addition, the guidelines for reintegration support will need t o be elaborated in the initial months o f the Project in order to proceed with  16  interventions under that sub-component. The Conditions o f Disbursement for the respective components are therefore as follows: Benefit Payment Operational Guidelines satisfactory to IDA have under Component 1: (i) GON has executed a memorandum o f understanding with each o f been prepared; and (ii) the Rastriya Banijya Bank, the Nepal Bank Limited, and the Nepal Rastra Bank, as applicable, setting forth implementation and internal control arrangements for Benefit payments under Part 1 o f the Project satisfactory to the Association. under Component (2)(a): MOF and MOPR have agreed on Guidelines for the Process o f Family Benefit Payments to eligible families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict, in form and substance satisfactory to IDA. under Category (2)(b): (i) Reintegration Support Operational Guidelines satisfactory the to the Association have been prepared; and (ii) Peace Commission, or any other the alternative mechanism acceptable to IDA, has endorsed the information provided by M O P R on cash payments to Maoists in cantonments and families o f deceased. There are also proposed to be several covenants, as follows: The Recipient shall ensure that: (i) Component 2, sub-component 2 o f the Project i s implemented in accordance with the provisions o f the Operational Guidelines for no reintegration support t o be developed; and (ii) action i s taken which would prevent or interfere with such implementation. The Recipient shall ensure that the identification and verification o f Beneficiaries under Components 1 and 2 o f the Project and the transfers o f transitional safety net payments to such Beneficiaries shall be made in accordance with the principles, criteria and procedures satisfactory t o the Association. The Recipient shall, by April 10, 2008 complete the staffing of, and thereafter maintain the Project Management Team (PMT) with functions and key professionals with skills, qualifications, experience and terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association. There are also several FM-specific covenants, as follows: submission o f annual audited project financial statements; submission o f I P R each trimester; and annual work program and budget for each component would be shared with IDA.  17  Annex 1: Detailed Description o f Project Components N e p a l Emergency Peace Support Project  1. As highlighted in the main text o f the EPP, the project would consist o f three main components: (i) transitional safety-net allowance payments to Maoists in cantonments during a transitional period, (ii) cash benefits to the families o f those killed during the conflict and reintegration support for other conflict-affected populations, and (iii) capacity building o f key institutional structures in support o f the peace and project management support. These components are described below. 2. Component I: Transitional safety net payments to Maoists in cantonments during the transition period. Over 19,000 eligible Maoists have been placed in seven cantonments following the Peace Agreement, with commitment by political parties t o payment o f regular allowances to reduce the chances o f disenchantment and t o mitigate against a need for rentseeking behavior while the Maoists are encamped. These act in effect as transitional safety net payments. However, eight months o f payments were outstanding as o f mid-February 2008, and there are presently n o funds budgeted for forward payments that will be necessary for the months following elections. This component would finance transitional safety net payments for 19,602 Maoists in cantonments. The eligible Maoists were registered and verified by a two stage process involving the two parties to the conflict and UNMIN, which conducted a detailed verification o f each potential beneficiary and issued individual bar-coded identity cards t o those verified. The verification and registration process i s considered to have followed good international practice by Bank and UN staff familiar with similar operations in other countries.  3. The component would cover both payment arrears from July 2007 and forward payments for the period to mid-January 2009 for those registered through this process.12 The benefits would be paid out to the individual beneficiaries in the form o f individual checks for the initial payments, with an effort to move t o bank account deposits as the payment modality before the end o f the project-financed period o f b e n e f i t ~ . ' ~ The payment process would involve administrative officials, Maoists representatives and an agreed independent third party to witness the payment process. Payments would be made according to an agreed set o f guidelines, which are intended to ensure transparency in the process, and compliance with the guidelines would be a condition o f disbursement o f project funds for payments. Project financing would be provided on a reimbursement basis, providing an additional check on compliance with the agreed procedures. Details o f the funds flow arrangements and institutional roles are provided in the FM annex and Section E o f the main EPP o n Implementation Arrangements. The payments would be made in a single payment for arrears and then on a regular periodic basis for the forward payments. There would also be financing under Component 3 for a communications campaign to inform beneficiaries o f their entitlements and the payment process, as w e l l as surveys o f beneficiaries after payments begin to be made (though such surveys will need to be negotiated with the Maoists leadership in order to ensure that they provide useful insights into the payment process). Effective communications to beneficiaries, particularly in settings like cantonments, has been The breakdown o f the 19,602 is: (i) 18,789 f i l l y verified Maoists in cantonments; (ii) 153 Maoists eligible but not in cantonment as providing VIP security services; and (iii) Maoists in cantonments 660 from Phase I1 verification also awaiting final decisions but eligible. For the latter two groups arrears are owed from November 2006. l3 The payment method contrasts with the one round o f payments made in 2007, where a lump sum payment was made to the Maoist camp commander for subsequent distribution to those in the cantonment.  18  shown in other parts of the world to be critical in terms of managing expectations and increasing the transparency of payment processes. Finally, there would need to be agreement on a grievance process for beneficiaries in the event of irregularities in the payment procedure and this would be reflected in the payment guidelines. While the ultimate period o f future residence in cantonments i s not known at this point, a cut-off date has been agreed with GON which balances estimates o f future need with the need for an exit strategy for the Bank. Benefit payments beyond January 2009 would be expected to be picked up within the budget through a proposal o f supplementary budget if required. I n addition to the financing o f transitional safety net payments, there would be provision for incremental operating costs associated with delivery o f benefits in a manner consistent with the Bank and GON’s fiduciary standards (e.g., logistical costs of physical delivery o f payments). Assuming payment o f arrears and an additional nine months o f payments, postelections, the estimated value o f this component i s US$18.55 million, of which US$550,000 would be for incremental operating costs.  4. Component2: Benefits to families o those killed as a result o the conflict and f f reintegration support to other conflict-affected populations. This component would have two sub-components: 5. Sub-component 1: The sub-component would finance benefit payments to survivor families o people killed as a result o the conflict. Therefore, this component would provide f f compensation payments to 14,000 plus families in the amount of NRs. 100,000 (US$1570) per person killed as per GON decision in March 2008. This would be paid as a lump-sum benefit, though payment would be spread over several months to achieve national coverage. These families were identified through a process conducted under the leadership of Chief District Officers (CDOs), with input from several sources to verify eligible families and with close review by higher levels o f administration and Government. These lists have therefore been officially endorsed and are maintained at the district level for families resident in each district. This process i s therefore considered to have done a reliable job of identification by national and international observers, including identifying the eligible individual in the families o f those killed who would be entitled to receive the payment.14 Given the significant lump sum amount o f the benefit, payments would be required to be made into bank accounts of individual beneficiaries in order to reduce risks. There would also be a set o f guidelines agreed for the payment process which would be required to be followed as a condition of disbursement of project funds for payments. This would include a role for local third parties who could advise beneficiaries in order to reduce the prospects o f both predatory behavior by others and ill-informed decisions by beneficiaries (though ultimately it would remain the prerogative o f individual beneficiaries how to use their benefit payments). As with first component, there would be provision for incremental operating costs associated with delivery o f benefits in a manner consistent with the Bank and GON’s fiduciary standards. There would also be linked support under Component 3 for a communications campaign to beneficiaries, special reviews of the payment process and beneficiary surveys which would be implemented from early in the process to gain insights into the effectiveness of the payment procedures and adjust them as necessary for other districts where payments are made later. There would also need to be a grievance process agreed as part of the payment guidelines. Given that the payment schedule across 75 districts i s expected to take place over several months, it i s hoped that the lessons from districts where payments are made first will be useful. The estimated size o f the payments and recurrent cost support under the first sub14  Confidence in the official number o f families with a member killed as a result o f the conflict i s bolstered by the fact that a national NGO (INSEC) conducted detailed information collection throughout the conflict on those killed through a network o f local investigators. Their figures on the number o f people killed as a result o f the conflict and their composition are remarkably close to the official numbers.  19  component i s US$23.23 million, o f which around US$455,000 would be for incremental operating costs.  6. Sub-component 2: The sub-component would provide support for reintegration assistance to other conflict-affected groups (e.g., people disabled in the conflict; internally displaced people (IDPs); families o f persons who have disappeared; minors involved in the conflict; orphaned children; widows). This could take a variety o f forms (e.g., training; legal and counseling services; rehabilitation services for disabled people; piloting o f interventions) and would be elaborated by GON with the assistance o f technical assistance (TA) provided under the third component and in close consultation with other development partners through the mechanism o f the Nepal Peace Trust Fund. Given the uncertainty o n the specific reintegration assistance and i t s scale, the team proposes that a dedicated pool be provided in the project to finance reintegration support for selected conflict-affected groups. This would be more specifically defined and programmed during the first year o f project implementation, including through pilot activities, and closely coordinated to maximize complementarity with the activities o f GON and the development partners. In order to promote close coordination with other donors, proposals for activities under this sub-component would be shared with the Technical Committee o f the NPTF (or such other body as mutually agreed with GON, development partners and the Bank). This would be consolidated into operational guidelines for accessing these funds which would be a condition o f disbursement for the sub-component, an approach used previously in Nepal under the Economic Reform Technical Assistance (ERTA) Project. It i s not expected that the funds proposed would be sufficient to cover the likely overall reintegration support needs o f these groups. However, as the policy framework i s elaborated by GON, additional resources could be made available through either reallocation o f existing funds or seeking supplemental financing as appropriate. The proposed amount for reintegration support interventions would be US$ 5 million. 7. Component 3: Capacity building o key institutional structures in support o the peace f f process and project management support. Given the relatively short project implementation period and nature o f interventions, this component i s estimated to cost US$3.22 million. This component would have three sub-components: 8. Sub-component 1: Capacity building and technical assistance for the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction to perform their corefunctions more effectively. This would include as an immediate priority i t s oversight role on payments to families o f deceased and Maoists in cantonments (e.g., strengthening the M I S system, internal procedures, communications campaigns for beneficiaries o f project-financed payments, and monitoringheporting, including beneficiary surveys), and programs for other conflict-affected groups such as orphans, widows, and disabled people. In addition, it would include technical assistance and capacity building for performance o f the Ministry’s roles in supporting the peace process support, within an overall vision o f the Ministry as a coordinator rather than executor. This would include training, legal advisory support for i t s secretariat functions in drafting new policies and procedural guidelines, advisory services on development o f GON’s overall reintegration strategy and specific reintegration interventions programs, and capacity for information education campaigns (IEC) which are considered a critical element in building awareness and confidence in the overall peace process. The component would promote exposure to best international practices in reintegration, reconciliation and rehabilitation, devising appropriate mechanisms for integrating peace and developmental activities, reorienting sectoral ministries towards conflict-sensitive design o f development projects, and supporting effective functioning o f the peace focal points in each ministry. The technical assistance under this component would inform design o f the reintegration support activities for various groups to be financed under Component 2. I t will be critical to  20  ensure that more specific definition o f TA support i s done in close coordination with other development partners, several o f which have or plan for ongoing support for peace and reintegration activities. The proposed vehicle for ensuring such harmonization o f approach i s the NPTF .  9. Sub-component 2: Support for core project implementation tasks o the Project f Management Team (PMT) such as procurement, financial management (FM), including evaluation o f project interventions through surveys and other assessment tools. The PMT would be located in the MOPR, with staff from relevant departments, including the cantonment management unit which sits in M O P R but reports to MOF. The PMT would also have a key role in ensuring that the agreed guidelines for payments to Maoists and cantonments and families to those killed as a result o f the conflict were followed, including channeling financial support for incremental operating costs associated with delivery o f the payments.  10. Sub-component 3: Training, workshops and technical assistance for other actors in the peace process as needed, including the Peace Commission once formed, the Peace and Conflict Management Committee if required, Local Peace Committees, and other groups such as parliamentarians and possibly other bodies related to the peace process envisaged in the 23PA.l’ The priorities for use o f the funds under this sub-component would be determined in light o f GON’s priorities for support t o the peace process and in close consultation with the technical Committee o f the NPTF or such other politically inclusive mechanism as agreed with GON and other development partners.  ’’  The 23 Point Agreement foresees the formation o f a set o f high level bodies which would help carry the peace process forward. Apart from the Peace Commission, these include the Commission for the Investigation o f the Disappeared, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, State Restructuring Commission, Study and Recommendation Commission for Scientific Land Reform, and the High Level Committee for Monitoring the Effective Implementation o f the CPA and Other Agreements.

The Nepal Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) that was conducted jointly by the Government o f Nepal (GON) and IDA in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005, concluded that the failure to comply with the impressive legal and regulatory fiduciary framework makes the fiduciary risk in Nepal “High”, but the risk i s similar to that in most developing countries. The situation has not significantly changed. The draft Public Financial Management (PFM) Review (May 2007) have reaffirmed that the P F M system in Nepal i s well designed but unevenly implemented. The Public Financial Accountability Assessment (PFAA) issued in February 2008, has also reiterated that the fiduciary risk in Nepal continues to be “High”. The GON, however, i s committed to improving the overall financial accountability framework. This has been demonstrated by promulgating the Public Procurement A c t and Public Procurement Regulations in 2007, amending the Financial Administration Regulations in 2007, and also leading the self-assessment o f various P F M Indicators as per Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) Guidelines. Further work on P F M including setting up the PFM benchmarks as per the PEFA Guidelines carried out in 2007, and subsequent implementation o f actions that need to be agreed with GON will help to mitigate the inherent country risk. Background on the ImplementingAgency and Program  2. The Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction (MOPR) was established by GON in 2007 (by the decision o f the Government o f Nepal, Allocation o f Business Rules, 2007, as published in the Nepal Gazette on M a y 7, 2007) with the following key mandate: (i) formulate, implement and monitor the immediate and long-term policies, strategies, plans and programs for the establishment o f peace, conflict management and reconstruction o f physical infrastructures formulate policies, strategies and programs o f social and economic damaged due to conflict; (ii) monitor the implementation o f various peace development o f conflict-affected regions; (iii) agreements including the Comprehensive Peace Accord; and (iv) a ssume transitional management o f the peace process and conflict-related reconstruction plans. 3. The proposed emergency operation on Peace Support i s t o respond t o GON to contribute to the consolidation o f the Nepal peace process to ultimately result in bringing a lasting development impact. The overall objective o f the project i s t o contribute to the consolidation of the Nepal peace process by supporting: (i) Government to meet commitments to selected groups affected by the conflict, including families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict, conflictrelated widows and orphans, disabled people, and individual Maoists in cantonments; (ii) ensuring transparency in implementation o f benefits under the Project for the conflict-affected strengthening o f key institutions which are groups, including the Maoists in cantonments; and (ii) tasked with policy and implementation functions in peace building, reintegration and rehabilitation. The primary target group o f beneficiaries i s the estimated 19,602 eligible Maoists in cantonments from Maoist who are currently placed in seven cantonments following the Peace Agreement and the survivor families o f the estimated 14,344 deceased people who were killed during the conflict. The proposed emergency operation will have three components: (a) cash transfers to Maoists in cantonments during the transition period; (b) cash transfers (one time) to families o f victims killed as a result o f the conflict and initial reintegration support to other  28  conflict-affected populations; and (c) capacity building for M O P R and key institutional structures in support o f the peace process. Adequacy of Financial Management Arrangements  4. The project i s an emergency response t o GON’s request to support the consolidation o f the Nepal peace process. There i s a high level commitment at the political level to ensure lasting peace in Nepal. A clear indicator o f this i s the signing o f the 23 Peace Agreement (23PA) among the top leaders o f the seven political parties toward implementation o f the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In response t o this, the Council o f Ministers issued directives on December 24, 2007 to all ministries to ensure timely implementation o f the 23PA. The proposed emergency operation i s a response to contribute towards implementation o f the comprehensive peace agreement and sustainable peace and stability in the post conflict context o f Nepal. GON has established strategic priorities for peace-related efforts, and the proposed operation i s targeting to address some o f those priorities as explained above. In order to respond to two core areas o f cash transfers to Maoists in cantonments and to the families o f persons killed as a result o f the conflict, GON has already established an institutional mechanism for cash transfers coordinating closely with UNMIN, the U body responsible for authenticating eligible Maoists in cantonments and N which has oversight in cantonment sites in seven districts. Similarly, GON has made a Cabinet level decision (on October 8, 2007) regarding the norms o f rates t o be paid t o the Maoists in cantonments, which form a basis for the cash transfers to the made t o them. Regarding the one time cash transfers to the eligible families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict, G O N i s relying on the record and certification o f the 7 5 CDOs who are the authorized district authorities for maintaining such records. A Directive describing the norms for financial support to such families was approved by the Cabinet in March 2008. For greater transparency and for ensuring better controls on cash transfers, modification o f the current system i s warranted which i s described in this assessment, which has been discussed and agreed with GON. This i s to ensure that funds that are disbursed following the approved norms actually reach the intended beneficiaries.  5. The institutional arrangements to implement the various cash transfer schemes are already in place. The M O P R has formed a PMT headed by the Project Coordinator (Joint Secretary o f the Conflict Management Division) and comprised o f representatives from other Divisions/Sections, including the Conflict Analysis and Policy Formulation Division, Relief and Rehabilitation Section, Planning and Monitoring Section and Cantonment Management Division. I t will include a dedicated Accounts Officer and a part-time Procurement Officer who will pull resourceshonsultants when required from the system when specific procurement support i s required. For Component 1, the PMT will work through the Cantonment Management Section which has a Cantonment Officer in each o f the seven cantonment siteddistricts. UNMIN has detailed information on each o f the Maoists in cantonments. For Component 2, the P M T will work through the 7 5 CDOs which are heading the authenticated authorized district offices which maintain records o f families o f people killed as a result o f the conflict. The Directives that are currently under the Cabinet review will form the basis to implement the cash transfers under the component. T o guide the MOPR and the PMT, the PC - or such interim politically inclusive body as mutually agreed pending formation o f the PC - would act as a high level oversight institution on project activities as part o f i t s broader function to oversee the peace process. Overall, the FM arrangements for the project are adequate at this initial stage o f project implementation with some modifications as will be described in this assessment. These will need to be further improved in the areas indicated below to ensure a satisfactory FM system throughout the project implementation.  29  Risk Analysis 6. High-level priority to From the FM perspective, the overall risk i s “substantial”. implement the 23PA, facilitation by UNMIN in the peace process, commitment o f seven political parties for sustained peace, and institutional arrangements that are in place are some o f the factors that aim to mitigate the risks. Overall, the decision to integrate the funding o f this program through the government’s financial management system will ensure adequate parliamentary oversight and scrutiny by other oversight agencies. Special efforts will be taken by M O P R to establish the monitoring system t o monitor the project activities. Arrangements will also be made for ex-post review o f cash transfers made under Components 1 and 2 through the use o f consultants. Further, there will be strong efforts to build capacity both in technical areas as well as overall project management including procurement and FM. The capacity building component would provide TA to MOPR to perform their core functions more effectively. Amongst others, it would also support training programs for various groups involved in the peace process including the PC, the LPC members and the targeted parliamentarians committees. T o address certain gaps that have been identified during the assessment, risk mitigation action plans have been agreed, and the risks will be reduced as the action plans get implemented. The creation o f the PC for policy guidance and oversight o n implementation o f peace process i s an indication o f the priority given to implementing this program. Strengths  7. The proposed operation has the following FM strengths: (i) high-level government and seven party commitment to implement the 23PA; (ii) UNMIN facilitation o f the peace process; (iii) policy decisions o f the Cabinet on cash payments to Maoists in cantonments and norms for cash payments to families o f people killed in the conflict; (iv) a strong P M T in MOPR under the leadership o f the joint Secretary; (v) ensuring the program follows existing country systems to make the process transparent with regard to the budget and the accompanying parliamentary oversight; and (vi) capacity building component to strengthen the technical capacity o f M O P R and peace-related efforts. Weaknesses and Resolutions  8. Deputation o f core staff in the P M T and their continuity throughout project implementation i s important for the successful implementation. An emergency operation like this one requires strong commitment and high level coordination both at the political and bureaucratic levels. Strong donor coordination i s also key to helping ensure a successfully implemented peace process. Developing the FM system and accountability framework in the MOPR i s also critical to ensure better accountability over funds disbursed and making information accessible to public. Integrating the Maoists in cantonments and families o f those killed in the conflict into the country’s development framework i s an opportunity that should not be overlooked. Planning and Budgeting  9. The proposed operation will follow the same government procedure as used with any normal budget line item. The budgeting procedures for preparation, approval, implementation, and monitoring are elaborated in the Financial Procedure Regulations (FPR). The annual work program and budget will be based on the work program to be prepared by MOPR. Annual work programs and budgets are submitted to the National Planning Commission (NPC) and MOF for discussion. The current fiscal year ‘Appropriation Book’ (Budget 2007/08) has three dedicated budget line items through which the project’s activities can be implemented. The budget lines  30  are: 95-4-976 (Peace Trust Fund - including cantonment management) or budget lines: 95-3-95 1 and 95-4-95 1 (contingency). All activities under this project will be “on-budget”.  10. MOF will release authorizations for expenditure to MOPR. The Secretary o f M O P R will issue authorization to the Secretary o f the Office o f Central Coordination for Cantonment Management (OCCCM) for Component 1 and to the Project Coordinator for Components 2 and 3 for disbursement o f funds. The Secretary o f O C C C M will issue spending authorizations to the Cantonment Officers located in seven districts (Jhapa, Sindhuli, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Rolpa, Surkhet and Kailali) and copy such authorization letters to the MOPR Secretary, the Financial Comptroller General and the District Treasury Controller o f seven districts. Fund release to the Cantonment Offices will then take place through a normal release procedure through respective District Treasury Controller Offices (DTCOs). The Secretary o f O C C C M will eventually be held accountable for disbursements o f funds under Component 1. Similarly, for Component 2, the Project Coordinator issues spending authorizations to the Chief District Officers (CDOs) o f 75 districts and copy such authorization letters to the MOPR Secretary, the Financial Comptroller General and the District Treasurer Controller o f 75 districts. Fund release to the CDOs will take place through a normal release procedure through respective DTCOs. The Project Coordinator and CDOs are held accountable for expenses under Component 2. Funds Flow Arrangements  11. GON will release the budget as per the approved work program for the project in three tranches as per i t s fund release procedures. The budget approved by GON will be indicated in the government’s budget (Red Book). Prior t o the approval o f the work program and budget, onethird release o f the previous year expenditures or projected expenditures for the first trimester, whichever i s greater, will be made to the respective cost centers through the respective DTCOs. Fund release for IDA’S share o f expenditures will be pre-financed through GON’s consolidated fund. Upon approval o f the work program and budget, appropriate adjustments will be made against the advance for the first trimester release. Subsequent second and third trimester releases are based on performance reflected by the physical progress reports as required by Schedule 2 o f the FPR.  12. For reimbursement o f IDA3 share o f expenditures to GON’s consolidated fund, a Special Designated Accounts will be established in Nepali Rupees at N B to facilitate quick payments o f R various activities under the project including the reimbursement under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. M O P R will designate the signatories t o operate the special designated accounts, and it will normally be the Project Coordinator and the Accounts Officer. Transactionbased (traditional) disbursement procedures will be applied for withdrawal o f funds from the grant. Reporting formats for the Implementation Progress Report (IPR; comprising physical progress report, financial monitoring report and procurement management report) will be prepared, discussed and agreed with the Bank prior to negotiations. Project Financial Accounting, Reporting and Internal Controls  13. In order t o ensure that project financial statements are consolidated, the PMT in M O P R will ensure that separate books o f accounts are maintained for the project and accounts are prepared on a cash basis. The P M T will coordinate overall activities and work under the guidance o f the M O P R Secretary and the PC. The P M T will be accountable t o prepare trimester IPRs and project financial statements. Accounting information will be regularly updated to timely generate financial reports. As required by government system, M O P R will maintain required ledgers including the Withdrawal Monitoring Register and Special Designated Accounts  31  Ledger. GON’s internal control system will be applied to monitor the progress o f the project in accordance with sound accounting practices. The accounting systems contain the following features: (i) application o f consistent cash accounting principles for documenting, recording, and reporting i t s financial transactions; (ii) well-defined chart o f accounts that allows meaningful a summarization o f financial transactions for financial reporting purposes; (iii) maintenance o f withdrawal monitoring register, the record o f SOEs and Designated Accounts register; (iv) the asset register; (v) monthly closing and reconciliation o f accounts and statements; and (vi) the production o f annual financial statements.  Financial Management Staffing  14. The PMT in MOPR will be the overall coordination office t o coordinate the overall implementation and day-to-day management o f project activities. An Accounts Officer has been designated to maintain the accounts o f the Project. H e will be supported by his assistants. As two o f the three components are “one-off” cash transfers, the current team o f staff i s capable o f handling the project transaction. Internal Control on Cash Transfers  15. Once the funds are released to the Cantonment coffers in the seven districts through the respective DTCOs for Component 1 (payments to Maoists in cantonments), a modification in the current system i s warranted in order to ensure that cash transfers take place to the intended beneficiaries. Transactions would be made only through checks in the name o f individual beneficiaries as per the approved l i s t o f eligible Maoists in cantonments by using the services o f banks with a network in the cantonment locations. Checks would not be transferred unless a GON representative from the cantonment management office and Maoist representative certify the eligibility o f payments as per the agreed norms. It would also be required that an independent third party witness the payment process, with GON and the Maoist leadership t o agree on and with such third party which is also acceptable to IDA. The agreement between the GON Maoist representatives and the third party would need to elaborate the scope o f the third party’s role in “witnessing the payments” which ensures a standard process for the role o f the third party witness. Documents based on which checks would be issued are the approved Attendance Roster, vouchers generated for payments to each individual and checks prepared based on such approved vouchers. Where feasible, beneficiaries will be encouraged t o open individual savings accounts so that payments can be made directly to their savings accounts. GON has entered into dialogue with the government owned banks t o facilitate the process. Arrangements will be made for mobile banks to provide services in a specified date in each cantonment. Maoists in cantonments would encash their checks through mobile banking. Banks will check the identity o f each individual, verify the check, and obtain receipts o f checks and payments from each individual. For Component 2 (payments to families o f deceased people), the Chief District Officer (CDO) will be accountable to verify and attest the receipt o f payments made t o the identified beneficiaries. One-off cash transfers in this case will also be made through banking arrangements through checks, preferably, in the individual savings accounts if not, through demand checks. Internal Review o f Cash Transactions  16.

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank’s “Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated M a y 2004 as revised as o f October 2006; and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” dated M a y 2004 and revised as o f October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description o f various items under different expenditure categories are described below. For each contract to be financed by the Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. Project Procurement Arrangements  2. The following procurement arrangements are proposed for the Nepal Emergency Peace Support Project. The Project Coordinator o f the Project Management Team has good experience and training in procurement (having undertaken the Turin-based procurement training course successfully). Additional procurement resource will be drawn upon o n a consultancy or on deputation as and when procurement function i s envisaged for substantial inputs. The dedicated procurement function could be expected to become close to full time as the technical assistance activities under the project expand, and especially as and when the Reintegration Support activities under Component 2 gain momentum.  3. Given the rapid project preparation under OP 8.00 and the need for greater clarity on the specific activities to be undertaken within the Reintegration Support activities sub-component during the first year o f implementation, it i s anticipated that the Bank’s Senior Procurement Specialist (based on New Delhi Office) will assist the Implementing Agency and Bank team in ensuring that procurement and consultant selection procedures and criteria for service provision, training and related activities under that sub-component are agreed in detail prior to initiation o f procurement o f such services. 4.  Procurement o f Works: There i s no works procurement under this Project.  5. Cash Payments: Cash payments to be made directly to Maoists in cantonments and families o f those killed during conflict under Components 1 and 2 are not subject to procurement procedures. 6. Procurement o f Goods: Goods procured under this project would include I T equipment and solutions (computers and peripherals, software, customized M I S ) that i s t o be procured through N C B by the Project Management Team located in the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction.  39  7. In addition, there will be some small value procurement o f miscellaneous goods (office equipment and furniture), printing (of dissemination material), etc., that shall be carried out by the Implementing Agency through N C B or shopping procedures. 8. N C B procedures to be used will be in accordance with national procedures as defined by the Public Procurement L a w and i t s related Regulations, and using bid documents reviewed by and agreed with the Bank. 9. Consultants: For contracts with consulting firms/institutions valued below US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract (under Component 3 and the Reintegration Support sub-component o f Component 2), the methods o f selection may either be QCBS, consultant's qualifications or Single Source Selection based on the appropriateness o f the procedures relevant to the requirements. 10. For contracts with NGOs and CBOs estimated to cost less than the equivalent o f US$ 200,000 per contract (under the Reintegration Support sub-component o f Component 2), the selection methods may be either Consultants Qualifications or Single Source Selection. For Individual consultants, no contract shall exceed US$200,000 equivalent per contract.  11. For consultancies estimated to cost US$200,000 or less, the shortlist can comprise entirely national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines. GON would also be i s encouraged to identify a "pool o f experts" or a l i s t o f "preselected" consulting firms/ individuals that may be appropriate for supporting the PMT, similar in concept to an indefinite Delivery Contract. Training  12. Non-consulting services under the project will include delivery o f seminars, training and limited study/exposure tours and shall be obtained from local service providers through request for proposals using a lump sum format o f contract or shopping. Procurement Capacity o f P M T  13. The Project Coordinator o f the PMT has hands-on experience o f implementing procurement in a Bank-funded project, as well as extensive prior experience in procurement according to Government systems. H e has also undergone training on Bank procurement procedures at I L O in Turin. In addition, given the need for dedicated procurement capacity, a procurement officer will be brought in who has Bank procurement accreditation, and the Bank and M O P R shall agree o n such other remedial measures deemed necessary to ensure the capacity i s adequate. This will be assessed by a more detailed procurement capacity assessment, which will be initiated in the nearest future and prior to Board consideration. Review requirements  (i)Post review o f sub-projects: At the end o f the first year o f the project, an independent agency shall be hired by the Implementing Agency to carry out post review o f Procurement carried out on a sample basis - the sample size being 10 percent o f contracts. In addition, to strengthen transparency, there would be public disclosure requirements for procurement actions (e.g., publication on M O P R website or other measures to be agreed at Negotiations).  40  (ii) Any I C B contracts, each contract for goods estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO equivalent and above, any shopping contract estimated at US$50,000 equivalent and above, and all single source/direct contracts estimated at US$20,000 equivalent and above shall be subject to prior review. (iii)Each contract for consulting services with f i r m s following QCBS, QBS or other competitive selection estimated at U S $ 100,000 equivalent and above; all contracts procured using CQ or single source selection methods that are estimated at US$ 50,000 equivalent and above, and all contracts with individuals valued at US$15,000 equivalent and above shall be subject to the Bank’s prior review.  Simplified Procurement Plan  14. Following i s a Simplified Procurement Plan (SPP) as per requirements o f O P B P 8.00 which covers the first months o f project implementation. A more detailed Procurement Plan will be developed in this period and subsequently be subject t o the usual requirements for procurement planning under Bank projects.

The three project components are: (a) Cash payment t o Maoists in cantonments; (b) One time cash payment to the family o f deceased and support for reintegration interventions for other conflict-affected groups; and (c) Capacity building and institutional strengthening o f the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction, and other institutions involved in the peace process, plus project management. The implementing agency for all three components i s the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction, under the oversight o f the Peace Commission once constituted. 2. The MOPR has formed a Project Management Team (PMT) headed by the Project Coordinator (Joint Secretary o f the Conflict Management Division) and comprised o f representatives from other Divisions/Sections - Conflict Analysis and Policy Formulation Division, Relief and Rehabilitation Section, Planning and Monitoring Section and Cantonment Management Division. The Team includes a dedicated Accounts Officer and a part-time Procurement Officer who will pull resources/consultants when required from the system when specific procurement support i s required. For Component 1, the Project Management Team will work through the Cantonment Management Section which has Cantonment Officers in seven cantonment siteddistricts. For Component 2 cash payments, the Project Management Team will work through the 75 CDOs which are authenticated authorized district offices which maintain records o f families o f deceased people killed during the conflict. T o guide the M O P R and i t s Project Management Team, the Peace Commission - once formed - would act as a high level oversight institution on project activities as part o f i t s functions in overseeing the peace process. Monitoring Arrangements:  3. The Project will be implemented following normal government systems, making the process transparent and budget vetted by the Parliament. This will ensure adequate control and monitoring o f funds disbursed through the government’s budgetary system. The fund flow, recording and reporting will be carried out through designated government institutions. The budget authorization i s given by the Ministry o f Finance t o the Ministry o f Peace and Reconstruction, which will be accountable to maintain project financial statements and reporting. The Financial Comptroller General Office maintains the central level consolidated financial information. The Supreme Audit Institute, the Office o f the Auditor General, will be accountable to carry out independent external audit. The Auditor General reports t o the Parliament, and audit findings are subject to external scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee. All cash transfers to identified beneficiaries are verified and vetted by: a) for cash transfers to Maoists in cantonments, by a tripartite team; and, b) for cash transfers to the family o f deceased, by the respective district verification committee headed by the Chief District Officer. The M I S will be developed in M O P R under capacity building component to ensure strengthening o f i t s monitoring system.  4. An important additional element o f monitoring under the project would be surveys/studies to be carried out on beneficiaries o f both cash payments and reintegration interventions. This would be used both to gain insights into the impacts o f these interventions, but also to learn and inform adjustments in future programs o f GON, development partners, and in the future possibly the Bank itself. In addition, for payments t o families o f those killed as a result o f the conflict, there i s planned to be a role in monitoring the payment process for local citizens o f good repute who can both oversee the payment process t o encourage transparency and be a source o f advice to beneficiaries. These citizens may be in local NGOs or other groups.  43  Annex 7: Project Preparation and Appraisal Team Members Nepal Emergency Peace Support Project  Team Member  Role  Philip O’Keefe, SASHD Roshan Bajracharya, SASPR Bigyan Pradhan, SAFWM Deborah Bateman, SACNA Hiroko Imamura, LEGES  Co-Task Team Leader Co-Task Team Leader Senior Financial Management Specialist Country Program Coordinator Senior Counsel  2.

N R C also upports the Government o f Nepal to draft Directives on mplementation o f the new I D P policies. JNDP  JNDP provided technical and administrative support to the 10 JNMIN verification units in the verification and registration n-ocess o f Maoists in the seven cantonments. In addition, UNDP ogether with UNMIN and UNICEF expect to provide support in he discharge o f ineligible Maoists in the cantonments. For this ictivity, UNDP will take the lead on discharging the ineligibles who were over the age o f 18 before 25 M a y 2006.  2NFPA  JNFPA, together with GTZ, i s supporting the P L A health workers, who are delivering health care (mainly curative services) in some i f the cantonment sites. In addition, UNFPA has also deployed loctors to some o f the cantonments in need o f personnel.  UNICEF  Shild protection officers from the UNICEF were involved in verifying the details o f registered Maoists who were under the age i f 18 before 25 M a y 2006. This process was coordinated by UNMIN and included personnel from the UNDP. In addition, UNICEF i s expected to provide support in the discharge o f ineligible Maoists in the cantonments who were under the age o f 18 before 25 May 2006. UNICEF and OHCHR support efforts to make cantonments consistent with the rights o f children, and support the integration o f children affected by the conflict through youth clubs and catch-up education.  United Nations Mission in (N NepalUm  UNMIN i s a special political mission established in January 2007 to support the peace process in Nepal and continues i t s mandate until 22 July 2008.

  * Facebook     * Twitter     * LinkedIn     * Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the region with a population of about 24 million people scattered throughout remote mountainous villages. Several structural factors hindering the country?s attempts at development include: (i) the difficult terrain of a mountainous, landlocked country, (ii) low levels of physical infrastructure resulting in many remote areas without connectivity to the rest of the country, and (iii) lack of good governance. An overall level of telephone density for both fixed and cellular services is low. Many villages do not have access to telecoms services. Broadcasting services are not available to all villages. Information and communications technology (ICT) services are limited to major urban areas. The decentralization of economic activities away from Kathmandu Valley is hampered by the lack of basic infrastructure and poor communications system. With these constraints, Nepal has a huge potential to take full advantage of ICT, as it allows distribution of, and access to, information at no cost difference regardless of different spatial distances. Particularly in Nepal, the benefits of e-government will be far more extensive, especially compared with its networking cost. A majority of people living in remote areas could be empowered by ICT to gain access to public services at as affordable a price as enjoyed by people in Kathmandu Valley. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: B Indigenous Peoples: **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Any negative social and environmental impact will be minimal. Social and environmental aspects will be properly addressed. Environmental impact mitigation and land acquisition, if any, will be implemented and strictly monitored.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 07 Oct 2004     * Fact-finding: 27 Mar 2006 to 30 Mar 2006     * Approval: 30 Aug 2006     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The Project will reduce poverty in the rural communities of 11 EDR districts through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. The project outcome will be improved efficiency of production, marketing, and processing of HVCs such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR. The project outputs include (i) increased public and private investment in commercial agriculture, (ii) inclusion of poor and semicommercial stakeholders in commercial agriculture, (iii) timely availability of market information to farmers, and (iv) enhanced capacity of project partners in supporting farmers. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The Project builds on existing initiatives; responds to the needs of stakeholders; and ensures fairer benefits to poor disadvantaged communities and women. The Project is timely and based on sound experience; its design is consistent with ADB?s strategic focus under the CSP to (i) increase agricultural productivity (ii) increase agricultural income and employment opportunities for rural people, and (iii) increase commercialization of agriculture. ADB?s 2005?2009 country strategy and program (CSP) for Nepal links future ADB assistance to results sought by the Government to deal with the underlying causes and possible long-term effects of the recent conflict. Broad- based and inclusive social and economic development to achieve a steady decline in poverty is the adopted strategy. The results are in line with the objectives of the Government?s poverty reduction strategy (Tenth Five-Year Plan), which is built on four pillars: (i) broad-based and higher economic growth, (ii) social development, (iii) targeted programs for socially excluded groups, and (iv) good governance. The main thrusts of the CSP are (i) promoting greater development balance in different regions; (ii) improving access of the poor to basic services, opportunities for social advancement, and participation in the development process; and (iii) addressing the needs of disadvantaged ethnic groups, castes, and women. In project design, the CSP requires (i) simple design, (ii) service delivery through local stakeholders, (iii) demand-driven assistance, (iv) results-focused support, (v) flexible implementation modalities, (vi) community participation with social inclusion in overall project implementation, and (vii) greater transparency and accountability. These requirements guided design of the Project and are incorporated in its framework. **** Impact **** Reduced poverty in the rural communities of 11 districts in the Eastern Development Region (EDR) of Nepal through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Improved efficiency of marketing and processing high-value crops (HVCs) such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR Progress Towards Outcome Project implementation completed on 30 June 2013.

It was agreed to intensify environmental monitoring in project implementation; avoid use of private property or submit as an annex to SCN a consent letter signed by owners and endorsed by village development committee or an independent NGO confirming that lands were donated voluntarily to subproject; prohibit use of heavy equipment for construction works and adopt labor-based approach; replant cleared trees at 1:25 ratio; carefully implement integrated pest management; and select subprojects based on priority. It was also agreed to increase technical staff for timely preparation, implementation monitoring and quality control of infrastructure subprojects. The quarterly progress report will include a section on status of environmental safeguards compliance in infrastructure and non-infrastructure subprojects. Involuntary Resettlement There is community infrastructure included in the commercial agriculture packages but no proposal from the beneficiaries has been accepted that might involve involuntary resettlement. However, the resettlement component is reflected in each of the proposal selection criteria. While selection of subprojects, the Project is carefully considering that no person is adversely affected due to land acquisition, resettlement or land donation and in terms of ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the prevailing laws and regulations of the country. Indigenous Peoples The Project has no negative impact on indigenous people. The Project has been addressing the issues of social and economic exclusion through its component 2: inclusive development of stakeholders, which assists disadvantaged people and poor subsistence farmers to develop and participate in income-generating agricultural activities. Social Development Specialist at PMU has been assisting in ensuring the equitable distribution of project resources and equal access to project activities and structures. The associated JFPR grant targets and benefits the most disadvantaged people by focusing on building their capacity and on income generation opportunities through a specialized package of targeted support to ensure their participation. The Project has made a considerable progress in achieving the targets. Out of 274 CAA members, women comprise 48%, dalit 6%, janajati 41%, and others4 53%, which meets the GAP target. Of the total CAA members, farmer groups are 47%, cooperatives 32%, traders 11%, and processors 10%. Out of the total farmer groups, women only groups are 12%, while women only cooperatives are 20%. Rest of the farmer groups and cooperatives has women and men members. The traders (16) and processors (13) are mostly male groups. Of the total 25,144 subsistence and semi-commercial members, women are in high numbers 66% subsistence and 51% semi-commercial. Similarly, representation of dalit (26%) and janajati (53%) are also high in subsistence groups. The Project has institutionalized the systemic collection of disaggregated data from the field to centre, and proper formats have been used for periodic monitoring and reporting. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Participatory design workshops with stakeholders conducted at several stages during PPTA implementation. During Project Implementation The Project will reduce rural poverty in the EDR through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. Impacts include increased economic activities and jobs in the project area. Social inclusion activities will promote the participation of all stakeholders including the poor, disadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; help them receive fair benefits from such participation; and in turn contribute to restoring peace and stability in the EDR. The Project will directly generate employment opportunities for subsistence stakeholders by promoting HVC production and marketing, transporting products from the field to storage and processing centers, and assisting small-scale community-based market infrastructure development. The landless poor will, through skill-based training, be made more employable and capable of income generation. Commercial stakeholders will be assisted to add value to agriculture products and encouraged to adopt socially inclusive behavior to help the less advantaged. **** Status of Covenants **** Category                     Rating Grant 0063 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     &ndash; Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         Satisfactory Project Financial Statements &ndash;   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program.

 * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The proposed loan and grants will directly address the urgent needs attributed to the electricity supply crisis in Nepal, through rehabilitation of two hydropower plants, supply-side energy efficiency, and demand-side management. The transmission network strengthening will also add supply capacity by increasing evacuation of power from hydropower stations in the western region and allow increased energy imports across the western border in the short term. In the medium term, the transmission network strengthening will allow cross- border energy exports, while distribution strengthening will facilitate additional consumer connections and increased energy efficiency. PPPs in distribution will help the NEA to pilot private sector involvement in improving distribution efficiency. These project interventions will also lead to improved financial performance of the NEA and sustainability of the sector through increased revenues, reduced losses, and improved efficiency. **** Impact **** Increased access to electricity across the country **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Reliable and energy efficient power supply with increased access and operational efficiency in the project areas.

Involuntary Resettlement A full resettlement plan (RP) was prepared during project preparation in consultation with affected parties, local authorities, and the NEA, in accordance with ADB s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The project requires a total of 4.66 ha of land for permanent acquisition and 21.39 ha land requires restriction of use for TL right of way (ROW).However, the routing of transmission line is slightly changed during implementation of 1 package to reduce the impacts. Thus EA is currently in the process to update the RP. Indigenous Peoples No adverse impact is expected on indigenous people s communities. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Consultation with NEA officials was focused to solicit project-related data and documents and to gather further information required for project preparation activities. District stakeholders were consulted to inform them about the project, collect required information and suggestions relevant to the project, and seek their support tor project preparation. Consultation with the local community, including the project-affected families, was undertaken to (i) disseminate information about the proposed projects and likely impacts, (ii) solicit their view and suggestion, (iii) collect socioeconomic and census data, (iv) assess the scope of effects on private and community assets, (v) financial assistance to be made to the affected people. During Project Implementation Regular review missions and regular meetings are conducted by ADB. **** Status of Covenants **** Category                     Rating Loan 2587 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     Satisfactory Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash; Grant 0182 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     Satisfactory Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash; Grant 0183 Sector                       &ndash; Social                       &ndash; Financial                    &ndash; Economic                     &ndash; Others                       &ndash; Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash;   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program.

Introduction  1. An IDA education team1 for Nepal carried out the second Project Implementation Support Consultations (ISC) for the Enhanced Vocational Education and Training Project (EVENT) from July 25 to August 6, 2012. 2. ISC Objectives: The objectives of the consultations were to review implementation progress on the following: (i) project components, implementation arrangements and quality of implementation in terms of human resources, processes and timeliness of activities; (ii) activities related to the project’s Disbursement Linked Indicators; (iii) disbursement of grants to scholarship recipient students, and management of scholarship student database; (iv) implementation of performance and matching grant programs, (v) implementation of short-term training programs; (vi) communication and outreach activities; (vii) establishment and functioning of a monitoring and evaluation system for the project; and (viii) progress made on actions agreed in the first review consultations. The consultations also reviewed governance, financial management, procurement, social safeguards and environmental aspects of the project. Key issues were identified, agreements reached, and an action plan prepared describing the next steps to be undertaken to speed up project implementation. 3. The IDA team met with senior officials of the Government of Nepal (GON), including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the National Planning Commission (NPC), Ministry of Education (MOE), the Council of Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT), the National Skills Testing Board (NSTB), Training Institute for Technical Instruction (TITI), Student Financial Assistance Fund Development Board (SFAFDB), and Employment Fund (EF). The team also held focus group discussions with EVENT scholarship recipients, and graduates of the lead, assistant and master trainer training programs and the skills test assessor and manager training program funded by EVENT. The team would like to thank all the officials of the institutions visited, and the EVENT Project Secretariat for organizing the ISC meetings and visits, and for their cooperation and hospitality. 4. This Aide Memoire reports on consultations findings and recommendations, and agreements reached on next steps vis-a-vis the above objectives. This Aide-Memoire was discussed at pre- wrapup meetings with the Ministry of Education on August 5, 2012 and with the National Planning Commission on August 6, 2012. A wrap-up meeting was held with the Ministry of Finance on August 6, 2012. 5. As agreed with the MOF, this aide-memoire will be classified as a public document under the World Bank's Access to Information Policy.  1  Saurav Dev Bhatta (co-TTL, Senior Education Specialist), Sangeeta Goyal (co-TTL, Senior Economist), Mohan Prasad Aryal (Operations Officer), Venkatesh Sundararaman (Senior Economist), Uddhav Kumar Bhandari (Economist), Jayakrishna Upadhaya (Research Analyst), Bigyan Pradhan (Senior Financial Management Specialist), Nagendra Nakarmi (FM Assistant), Kiran Ranjan Baral (Senior Procurement Specialist), Shambhu Prasad Upreti (Procurement Specialist), Hiramani Ghimire (Senior Governance Specialist), Bandita Sijapati (Social Development, Consultant), Drona Raj Ghimire (Environmental Specialist), and Agni Kafle (TVET specialist, Consultant). Sushila Rai (Program Assistant) provided all the logistical support for these consultations.  1  II.  Key Achievements    Hundred and sixty percent of the FY 2011/12 target for the training of master trainers (DLI 2) and 100% of the target for the training of lead and assistant trainers (DLI 1) were met.    Eighty four percent of the FY 2011/12 target for the training of skills test assessors (DLI 3) and 72% of the target for the training of skills test managers (DLI 4) were met. These results were achieved in a period of five months, compensating for the delay in project start-up.    Scholarship candidates from Technical School Leaving Certificate (TSLC) programs have received 100% of the payment for FY 2011/12.    A total of 87 firms have been shortlisted to provide results-based short-term training to 7,500 beneficiaries. The evaluation of their technical and financial proposals is nearing completion.    A total of 4,132 candidates (103% of the annual target in the Results Framework) were tested for the Recognition of Prior Learning.    Arrangements have been made for third party verification of the DLI outputs 1-4 through the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program.    The verification of DLI outputs 1-4 will be done jointly by the PS and IDA as an exception for FY 2011/12 and will be completed by September 31, 2012.    The Financial Management Information System (FMIS) is fully operational. The programs are almost ready for the project Management Information System (MIS) but the software for the server is yet to arrive.    The Implementation Progress Report (IPR), including the Financial Management Report (FMR), for the second trimester (FY 2011/12) was submitted on time and has been approved.    Total disbursement as of July 28, 2012 is USD 6.79 million (13.58% of total IDA financing). III.  Critical Issues and Challenges affecting Implementation  Critical issues and challenges that need to be effectively addressed to ensure that the gains from key achievements are sustained and further implementation progresses in a timely manner include inter alia:   Establishment of a comprehensive and effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) system for short-term training. The training will commence once the M & E system is in place.    Timely selection of short-term training providers, and the delivery of short-term training within the current fiscal year (FY 2012/13). Two rounds of selection and training delivery are planned.    Timely signing of MoUs between the PS, TITI, and CTEVT, and between the PS, NSTB and CTEVT for the delivery of targets specified in Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLI) 1-4 for FY 2012/13.    Timely signing of an MoU between the PS and CTEVT for the delivery of targets specified in DLIs 5-7. 2    Timely initiation of an intensive media and information dissemination campaign to ensure that potential beneficiaries of EVENT scholarship know about and apply for scholarships in the next round.    Timely completion of scholarship candidate selection for FY 2012/13.    Finalization of performance criteria for grants to public and private TSLC/Diploma training institutions.    The establishment of a functional MIS by the end of August, 2012.    Hiring of individual consultants for the PS Technical Team by October 15, 2012.    Submission of updated procurement plan for FY 2012/13 by the end of August 2012.  IV.  Component-wise Implementation Progress, Issues and Recommendations  6. Project Development Objective: The Project Development Objective is to expand the supply of skilled and employable labor by increasing access to quality training programs, and by strengthening the technical and vocational education and training system in Nepal. 7. The project consists of the following four components: (1) Strengthening TEVT Regulatory Activities and Capacity Building; (2) Strengthening Technical Education; (3) Support for Short-Term Training and Recognition of Prior Learning; and (4) Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. Component 1: Strengthening TEVT Regulatory Activities and Capacity Building 8. This component focuses on the regulatory environment and institutional resources available to the TEVT sector to draw upon for current functioning and future development. Disbursements under this component are results-based and linked to specific outputs and milestones for each activity supported. 9. In spite of a delay in project start-up, very good progress has been made towards the achievement of targets for DLIs 1-4. As summarized in Table 1, the FY 2011/122 target for the training of master trainers (DLI 2) has been exceeded by 60%; and 100% of the target for the training of lead and assistant trainers (DLI 1) has been met. Although the targets for the remaining two DLIs have not been fully met, the progress should be considered satisfactory considering that the MoU between the PS and NSTB for the achievement of DLIs 3 and 4 was signed only five months ago3.  2  The DLI achievements are for FY2011/12 for reimbursement after verification in FY2012/13. The MoU between the EVENT PS and NSTB for the training of skills test assessors (DLI 3) and managers (DLI 4) was signed on February 26, 2012. Similarly, the MoU between the EVENT PS and TITI for the training of master trainers and lead/assistant trainers was signed on January 19, 2012. The training for all four categories of trainees was conducted by TITI. 3  3  Table 1: Achievement of targets for DLIs 1-4 DLI description  FY 2011/12 FY 2011/12 % of target target achievement achieved DLI 1: Number of lead and assistant 200 200 100% trainers trained DLI 2: Number of master trainers trained 25 40 160% DLI 3: Number of skills test assessors 1,250 1,050 84% trained DLI 4: Number of skills test managers 100 72 72% trained 10. During the course of the consultations, the joint review team held discussions with groups of lead and assistant trainers, master trainers, skills test assessors and skills test managers trained by TITI as part of the EVENT project. The training graduates were unanimous in their view that the training was of high quality in terms of management, content and delivery. 11. The PS has met the minimum targets for DLIs 1-4 for the year 2011-12. Reimbursements for the achievement of DLI targets 1-4 will be made by IDA after the PS submits its achievement report and IDA independently verifies the outputs. Because of a delay in the selection of an appropriate organization to carry out the third party verification, it has been agreed that the verification of outputs for DLIs 1-4 for FY 2011/12 will be done jointly by IDA and the PS ‘as an exception.’ Starting FY 2012/13, the verification will be done by a third party. Arrangements have been made for third party verification of these DLI outputs through the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program. The joint verification of outputs for FY 2011/12 will be completed by September 31, 2012. 12. For each fiscal year, IDA disbursements will be made independently for each DLI according to the outputs achieved. For each DLI, a minimum of 50% of the annual target must be achieved for any disbursement to be made for that year. However, if the achievement is below 50%, the outputs from the following year(s) can be used to make up for the shortfall. 13. The preparation of the MoU between the PS and CTEVT for strengthening the CTEVT affiliation system (DLI 5), strengthening the CTEVT examination system (DLI 6) and scaling up the Training Management Information System or the CTEVT TMIS (DLI 7) has been delayed, and now is undergoing revision to be signed and made operational in this fiscal year. It has been agreed that the MoU will be submitted by the PS to IDA for review and clearance by August 15, 2012, and the MoU will be signed between the two parties by September 30, 2012. The plan for developing/revising 20 TSLC and Diploma level courses may be included as part of the same MoU. 14. For the next cycle of DLIs 1-4 for FY 2012/13, it has been agreed that the PS will submit the MoUs that need to be signed between the PS, CTEVT and TITI for DLIs 1-2, and the PS, CTEVT and NSTB for DLIs 3-4, to IDA for review and clearance by August 12, 2012, and complete the signature process by August 25, 2012. IDA strongly recommends that the time-line agreed to be adhered to so that the momentum gained in the achievement of these DLI outputs is maintained, and there are no gaps in the transition from the first cycle to the next. Component 2: Strengthening Technical Education 15. This component focuses on strengthening technical education at the Technical School Leaving Certificate (TSLC) and Diploma levels provided by CTEVT constituent and affiliated institutions, 4  and Community School Annex Programs (CSAPs) by providing Matching Grants 4, and Performance Grants5 on a competitive basis6 (see Annex 4 for details). 16. Matching Grant: IDA has cleared guidelines for the selection of TSLC and Diploma training institutions, including the distribution mechanisms of these grants to institutions, subject to the PS incorporating comments provided. LOI for matching grants for the first round has been published and the last date for receiving applications is August 4, 2012. Short-listing of eligible institutions for the first round is expected to be completed by August 18, 2012. Call for LOIs for matching grants for the second round will be published by August 31, 2012. Between October 15 and November 1, 2012, selection of institutions from both rounds of calls for proposals will be completed. Performance Grant: The PS has shared an initial draft of guidelines for selection of private TSLC and Diploma training institutions for performance grants. Institutions selected for support under matching grants are automatically eligible to receive funds under performance grants. The PS still needs to finalize the mechanism for distributing performance grants to the selected institutions. During the consultations, 11 performance indicators under 3 different categories were agreed upon: (i) quality and efficiency – 4 indicators: (ii) equity – 3 indicators; and (iii) expansion and innovation – 4 indicators (see Annex 4). Indicators and formulae for computing performance grant amounts for supported institutions will be piloted and finalized by August 15, 2012. It was agreed that the PS will share the updated draft of the guidelines with IDA for review and clearance by August 31, 2012, and publish call for proposals from private affiliated institutions by September 15, 2012. 17. CTEVT affiliated eligible community technical institutions can also compete for matching and performance grants but the criteria for defining these institutions need to be clarified. During the consultations, criteria developed by CTEVT for the purpose were discussed. It was agreed that these criteria would be finalized after further discussion, that the final criteria should not conflict with those GON has already developed for community higher education institutions for public funding. 18. Scholarships for TSLC and Diploma students (FY 2011/2012): Of the targeted 1,104 scholarship recipients for the FY 2011/12, 904 (730 TSLC and 174 Diploma) were selected and have received the first and second installments (through Rashtriya Banijya Bank Limited). 19. Scholarships for TSLC and Diploma students (FY 2012/13): The Proxy Means Targeting (PMT) mechanism is being used to select this cohort of students. Tasks have been divided amongst the PS and SFAFDB through an MoU: the PS is responsible for information outreach and media campaign throughout the country and SFAFDB is mandated for timely distribution and collection of filled PMT forms from applicants, data entry and category-wise short-listing of applicants. The final selection will be done by the PS itself. Due to delays in signing the MoU and extension of the application submission deadline, selection of beneficiaries could not be completed before the students took CTEVT entrance exams as agreed earlier (to generate the largest pool of applicants for the scholarships as possible). Important tasks that still remain to be carried out before final selection are: a. verifying from the applicant database whether or not applicants have passed the CTEVT entrance exams; and b. field verification of information for at least 10% of applications. It was agreed that the PS will publish the list of scholarship recipients for FY2012/13 by October 30, 2012, and sign the participation agreements with selected candidates by December 15, 2012.  4  Three types of technical institutes eligible for Matching Grant: (i) CTEVT Constituent Institutes; (ii) CTEVT affiliated Community Institutes; and (iii) Community School Annex Programs. 5 Four types of technical institutes eligible for Performance Grant: (i) three types of institutes eligible for MG; and (ii) CTEVT affiliated Private Institutes. 6 Each type of institutions will compete among themselves to qualify for the grants.  5  Component 3: Supporting Short-Term Vocational Training and Recognition of Prior Learning 20. This component supports short term vocational training and the certification of technical and vocational skills acquired through informal means. Short-term Training 21. The project targets for short-term training for FY 2012/13 under the voucher-based and results-based financing modalities were 1,000 and 7,500 beneficiaries, respectively. While short-term training has not yet been launched, letters of intent (LOIs) from potential training providers have been received and evaluated by the PS for both modalities. 22. In the case of results-based short-term training, 87 firms were shortlisted from a pool of 170 that submitted LOIs, and were asked to submit their technical and financial proposals to the PS. Among the 170 applicants, training providers that met the project’s eligibility criteria (95 in total) were given Rapid Market Appraisal (RMA) training before the short-listing was done. The RMA training was conducted jointly by the PS and the Employment Fund (EF), utilizing the latter’s expertise and experience in RMA training. The evaluation of the technical and financial proposals for the 87 firms is nearing completion. These firms will be contracted to train a total of 7,500 beneficiaries during FY2012/13 for meeting the target from the previous year. 23. The PS has proposed a target of 11,000 beneficiaries for FY2012/13. It therefore plans to publish another call for LOIs for results-based short-term training after the launch of the first round. 24. As there will be over 900 short-term training events during FY 2012/13 alone, and each training event requires 4-5 monitoring visits7, a comprehensive and effective M & E system for short-term training must be in place before any short-term training is launched. In order to set up such a system in a timely manner, the PS has proposed a joint monitoring mechanism with EF whereby their existent extensive regional monitoring infrastructure, experience, and expertise can be utilized to effectively monitor short-term training under EVENT without any significant cost. The PS can also make use of resources of the MoE at the central, regional and local levels in the process The PIC will make a decision on the setting up of an appropriate M & E system by August 10, 2012. IDA will provide its no-objection for carrying out short-term training activities under this component once a sound M & E system is in place. 25. One issue raised by CTEVT and the PS during the consultations was the need to allow CTEVT constituent schools to provide short-term training under the project. It has been agreed that IDA and the PS will further discuss how this can be accomplished. Recognition of Prior Learning 26. Altogether 4,132 youth from 72 districts were tested for recognition of prior learning (RPL) in 38 centers across the nation. The certification process is on-going and is expected to be completed by September 2012. The advertisement for the next round of RPL will be published by November 15, 2012.  7  As each training event has an average class size of 20, there will be approximately 925 training events (18500 beneficiaries/20 beneficiaries per event) during FY 2013/14.  6  Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation Project Management: 27. The PS will finalize the Terms of Reference (TORs) and complete the hiring of the technical team consisting of individual consultants – procurement, Financial Management (FM) and M & E by September 2012. The PS has hired one media expert for developing communications strategies for the project. Given the increasing need for enhanced outreach, the TORs for this position need to be reviewed to cover a wider mandate. 28. Finalization of Project Implementation Manual: As also suggested during the last consultations, the PS will prepare two simplified guidelines in Nepali targeted towards the beneficiaries – one for scholarships or stipends and the other for users of Category 1 activities8. The work is already in progress and the PS aims to complete these by September 15, 2012. 29. Project website9: The PS has been advised to regularly update the project website and to upload all project documents including the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Project Implementation Manual (PIM), the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), guidelines prepared for various activities, advertisements for applications, aide-memoires etc. As much as possible, Nepali versions of the documents should also be prepared and uploaded. 30. Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E): The second trimester Implementation Progress Report [November 2011-March, 2012] has been submitted by the PS to IDA. It has been reviewed and approved by IDA. An update on the Results Agreement is provided in Annex 2. Component-wise Progress of the M & E System 31. Component 1: The monitoring forms and manuals for DLIs 1-4 have been developed. The monitoring tools and system for the remaining 3 DLIs will be developed after the MoU with CTEVT has been signed. Third party monitoring and verification of the outputs for DLIs 1-4 will be done by the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program. The joint verification of outputs for FY 2011/12 will be completed by September 31, 2012 32. Component 2: The PS is working on the monitoring tools, their manual and guidelines for this component. For PMT based scholarship to TSLC and Diploma students, the M & E tools for all stages of student selection processes (information dissemination, forms distribution and collection, data-entry, field verification, stipend distribution and student enrollment and attendance) have been finalized. While many of these forms could not be used this year as activities were already completed by the time the forms were developed, they will be used for the next round of student selection for scholarship support. Baseline data from institutions will be collected once they have signed the participation agreements (contracts/MoUs) with the PS. 33. Component 3: While the tools for monitoring both short-term training and RPL activities have been developed, an appropriate M & E system for short-term training is not yet in place. As the training will take place across many districts, the PS needs to quickly decide how to establish such a mechanism so as not to delay the launch of this activity. Baseline data from institutions will be collected once they have signed the participation agreements (contracts/MoUs) with the PS. 8  “Category” means a category set forth in the table in Section IV of Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement for the EVENT project between GON and IDA. 9 www.event.gov.np  7  34. Component 4: A formal MoU has been signed between the Employment Fund (EF)10 and EVENT to share knowledge and experience. Through this MoU, EF has provided pro-bono technical support to EVENT in the area of short-term training including conducting Rapid Market Appraisal training. The Project has also taken the EF electronic management information system (MIS) and adapted and expanded it to develop a comprehensive Project MIS for EVENT. 35. Programs for the MIS have been written but the server is not yet ready. The MIS consultant has completed developing formats for DLIs 1-4 under component one, all stages of the student selection processes (information dissemination, form distribution and collection, data-entry, field verification, stipend distribution and student enrollment and attendance) under component 2, and short-term training and certification of prior learning. A system of evaluation based on the monitoring tools and information fed in by end users received at the PS is being finalized. V.  Procurement  36. Project procurement planning and implementation status of the approved procurement plan has been satisfactory. Project procurement includes procurement of goods, services and non-consulting services. With regard to the implementation of the approved procurement plan, procurement of the activities under goods has met their target within the schedule or with some delay. Progress under the procurement of consulting and non-consulting services is only around 70%. The PS shared that the main reason for this was the delay in signing the MoU between the PS and CTEVT and between the PS and the Department of Labor. Short-term training is provided in both CTEVT constituent public and affiliated private training institutions. During the meetings, it has been agreed that the PS and IDA will have discussions on how CTEVT constituent schools can participate in the provision of short-term training under the project. It was also agreed that building on the experience gained by the Project and other agencies in conducting similar trainings, an appropriate method for selecting training providers will be worked out and based on all this an updated procurement plan for FY 2012/13 will be prepared and submitted to IDA by the end of August, 2012. VI.  Financial Management and Disbursement  37. Budget for FY2011/12 and Estimated Expenditures: The budget for EVENT is allocated under the budget head 3,501,353 (Recurrent) and 3,501,354 (Capital). Total budget of NRs.596.80 million (eqv. USD 7.20 million) has been allocated under Recurrent (NRs.479.70 million) and Capital (NRs.117.10 million). The review team noted that all anomalies in the budget as noted during the last review have now been corrected. Total estimated expenditures for FY2011/12 are only NRs.120.67 million, which is only about 20.2% of the approved budget. Of this, total recurrent expenditures were NRs.105.61 million or 22% o the approved Recurrent Budget and total capital expenditures were NRs.15.06 million or 12.9% of the approved Capital Budget. This indicates that the implementation during FY2011/12 was very slow. 38. Retroactive Financing. There is a retroactive financing provision in the legal agreement for expenditures incurred on or after May 16, 2011 under Categories 3 and 4. The review team confirmed that there are no retroactive financing incurred. 39. Budget for FY2012/13. Due to political situation affected by the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the government was not able to announce the annual work program and full budget for 10  The Employment Fund , which has extensive experience in short-term training, is guided by a steering committee chaired by the Joint Secretary of Planning at MoE. It also implements the IDA-funded Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative (AGEI) project.  8  FY2012/13. According to the decision of the government, only one third of previous year’s expenditures have been approved to be programmed for the first trimester. EVENT is preparing the work program and budget based on this decision. No major development expenditures will incur during the first trimester. The review team suggested to include the committed program and related expenditures in the work program and provide with appropriate justification if this exceeds the ceiling based one one-third expenditures of the previous fiscal year. 40. Disbursements. Total disbursement as of July 28, 2012 is USD 6.79 million drawn from IDA Grant as the initial deposit to the Designated Accounts. The Project has not drawn any funds from the categories. Key reasons for no disbursements are slow start up of the Project and delay in compliance with disbursement conditions. The second trimester Implementation Progress Report which includes Financial Monitoring Report has recently been approved, and it has not called for any documentation of expenditures nor required any further advance to the Designated Account. The review team noted that there has been some progress in the achievement of DLI 1 to 4, and upon independent verification and certification of the outputs achieved, some disbursement is expected under Category 1. 41. Disbursement Condition. There is a disbursement condition that relates to Category 1 and 2. Preparation of the Project Implementation Manual acceptable to IDA and adoption of the Manual is the disbursement condition in order to implement activities and disbursements incurred under these two categories. The disbursement condition for Category 2 was lifted in March 2012. Somehow lifting the disbursement condition for Category 1 was missed during this time, which was noted during this review. During the review period, IDA lifted the disbursement condition for Category 1. 42. Financial Management Action Plan. The review team reviewed the implementation of FM Action Plan as agreed during negotiations. Due to delay in project start up, there has been a slippage in a few actions. The review team discussed and agreed new time line for these actions, which are as follows: a. Finance Staff. There is an agreement that one Finance Officer and one Accountant would be put in place in the Project Secretariat by May 30, 2011. The Accountant is already in place, and the position of Finance Officer has been created. However, the Finance Officer position has yet to be filled. If there is a further delay in getting the Finance Officer in place, the Project agreed to use a temporary staff for this work, and also recruit a short-term consultant to provide support to the Project. In addition to provide financial management support to the project, the consultant will also play a key role in monitoring the financial management status of the beneficiaries of the Project. The Project agreed to share the terms of reference of the consultant with IDA for comments. The Project aimed to have the consultant on board by September 2012. The review team reminded the government the clause under Schedule 2, para 2 (d) of the Financing Agreement which specifies that critical staff will not be transferred until the completion of the Project. b. Computerized Financial Management Information System (FMIS). The review team noted that the FMIS is now operational. The whole financial transaction is now entered in the FMIS and all reports are generated through the system. 43. Financial Management. The project team has made good efforts in maintaining books of accounts as required by the government system. The review team noted that the books of accounts are all upto-date. The Project has now begun to deface the invoices with the PAID stamp after the payments are made. Internal audit has not taken place.  9  44. Implementation Progress Report: There are no outstanding implementation progress reports. The second trimester report for FY2011/12 has been received and approved. No progress is observed from the financial report of the second trimester. It did not warrant for any documentation or for any further advance. The review team reminded that the third trimester report of FY2011/12 is due on August 31, 2012. 45. Audit Report: The first unaudited report that will be required is for FY2011/12 which is due on October 15, 2012. The review team also reminded that the first audited report is for FY2011/12 which is due on January 15, 2013. VII.  Environmental Management and Social Safeguards  46. Environmental Management: The PS has prepared Matching Grant operational Guidelines, Performance Grant Operational Guidelines and Short-Term Training Guidelines. These Guidelines, inter alia, also contain environmental provisions. It was agreed that Chapter 3 of the ESMF will be provided as an annex in these guidelines. During the previous consultations, it was agreed that the trimester Implementation Progress Report (IPR) of the project will contain information regarding environmental safeguard activities. As of now, no subproject proposals for civil works have been received by the PS. 47. There have been delays in the following actions from the previous consultations for which new completion dates have been agreed: a) While the ESMF has been finalized it is yet to be translated into Nepali. It was agreed that the final English version of the ESMF will be uploaded on the project website and disseminated to potential partner institutions immediately; ESMF will be translated into Nepali by August 31, 2012, and disseminated by September 2012; b) during the orientation workshop for partner institutions, the ESMF provisions and requirements were not covered. It was agreed that in all forthcoming orientations, there will be one dedicated session on the ESMF; and c) although the IPR reports on environmental safeguards status, supervision report does not. It was agreed that supervision report now onward also cover environmental status. 48. During the consultations, the six-monthly environmental management status report to be prepared by the PS and the annual independent environmental compliance check were discussed. It was agreed that the PS will complete the necessary preparatory work for commissioning the latter soon. Considering the lack of environmental expertise within the PS, it was agreed that the PS will maintain a roster of qualified environmental specialists for obtaining their short-term services as and when required. As during the previous consultations, the IDA team reiterated their advice to the PS to coordinate with the Department of Education’s environmental engineer on matters related to environmental management in EVENT. 49. Social Safeguards: IDA has noted satisfactory progress made by the PS relating to social issues. In the previous year, the Proxy Means Test (PMT) method could not be used to select candidates for scholarships but an agreement has now been signed with SFAFDB to take this process forward. During the FY 2068/69, there were 904 TSLC/Diploma scholarships that were granted. Out of these, 445 recipients (49.2 percent) were girls. The PS has not yet analyzed the information on scholarship recipients along other dimensions of disadvantages such as caste/ethnicity, disability status, lagging regions, etc. It has been agreed that the PS will avail the disaggregated information to the IDA team by end-August 2012. 50. The IDA team also reviewed the ‘Matching Grant Operational Guide’ prepared for FY 2012/13, and has noted that incentive schemes for the vulnerable groups have been incorporated in accordance with the specifications contained in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for 10  the project. The team is also pleased to note that the media strategy developed for the project contains specific measures for targeting vulnerable groups in order to ensure that they are knowledgeable and aware of the scholarship schemes. 51. In terms of safeguards, the review team noted a few inconsistencies in the EMSF, PIM and PAD, that needs to be corrected before the final version of the ESMF is publicized in the project website, translated and disseminated. These include different information on the age limits of the trainees, installments for short-term training, and information on land acquisition. The PS has agreed to make these changes immediately. 52. The PIM also includes provisions for social screening of potential projects prior to inviting full subproject proposals. The PS has not yet developed a checklist or a template for social screening. The IDA team has recommended, and the PS has agreed that a checklist for social screening that is akin to the Environmental Screening Checklist will be developed by end-August 2012. 53. Monitoring and Reporting: The PS has agreed that the MIS for the project will incorporate disaggregated information along the various dimensions of vulnerability that the project seeks to address (e.g., gender, caste, ethnicity, lagging regions, etc.). 54. The IPR and supervision related reviews for the project do not report on the implementation of social and environmental management issues on a regular basis. The PS has agreed to incorporate them from now onwards even if there are no major issues to be reported. 55. Finally, the IDA team has noted that a Grievance Redress Mechanism provisioned for in the ESMF has not yet been institutionalized effectively. The project website includes provisions for ‘feedback’ and other types of complaints are handled by project officials as and when people come to the project office to complain. The PS has agreed to formalize the GRM by putting up a ‘Suggestion Box’ in the project office, starting a Complaint Register, and designating a staff to handle complaints/grievances by end-August 2012. VIII.  Governance  56. The Coordination Committee (CC), Project Implementation Committee (PIC), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and PS have been constituted as per agreement. Clear terms of reference for the CC, PIC, TAC and all PS staff have been prepared and have received clearance from IDA. CTEVT is represented in the CC and PIC, and leads the TAC. The CC which is not a project specific entity but responsible for all vocational activities across the Government has yet to meet. There has been considerable delay in the passage of NSTB, one of the key implementation partners of EVENT, byelaws (original agreed date April 21, 2011) with implications for the project’s agreed action on granting greater autonomy to NSTB. Apart from the project action, the recently adopted TEVT policy of the Government foresees more autonomy to NSTB. This needs therefore to be expedited. The CTEVT has agreed to pass the bye-laws by September 30, 2012. 57. The project must have a strong monitoring system. Among other things, the Project should engage third-party monitors in verifying selected project activities, to assess the correctness of information submitted by individual beneficiaries and supported training providers. CARTA has been contracted to carry out independent monitoring services for DLI 1-4 outputs, which is encouraging. With the start of selecting short-term training providers from the private sector who will be conducting more than 900 training events across more than 20 districts, the project’s monitoring capacity needs to enhance significantly, especially at the local level. Among options available to the PS, is the possibility of engaging the Employment Fund to monitor project activities. The EF has technical 11  expertise and experience in the area of short-term vocational training and is already present in all five development regions and working with them could be more efficient and cost-effective than adding staff to the PS. Each short-term training event needs to be monitored at different stages from the selection and enrollment of trainees, delivery of training, testing and certification of trainees and their job placement. From a governance and accountability perspective short-term training should not be launched before a sound M & E system is in place. 58. The project is committed to developing and publishing service standards for contract management, scholarship process and inter-agency coordination so that the quality of delivery could be assessed against these standards. Work in this area, however, has not started yet. The project’s grievance handling system needs to be managed more systematically. This has been an ad hoc exercise so far. For example, the project received some complaints on scholarship and PMT; they have been resolved through dialogue with complainants. Going forward, two steps would be important. First, a system should be in place to handle grievances with mechanisms to track progress. Second, information on the system should be disseminated widely so that people know how to approach project authorities in case they are not happy about any aspect of the project. As an immediate improvement, EVENT website could offer some space for grievances, with a tracking system in place. 59. GAAP Implementation: Most GAAP actions are in progress, although they were delayed. The Project itself took some time to take off, which explains why many GAAP actions missed their original deadline. As part of the review, an updated GAAP (Annex 6) has been agreed with project participants. IX.  Next steps and agreed action plan  60. The agreed actions for the next trimester, and target completion dates are provided in Table 2 below. The next set of consultations/joint review is tentatively scheduled for January 2013.  12  Table 2: Agreed Action Plan (August – November, 2012) S. N.

Three types of technical institutes are eligible for MG: (i) CTEVT Constituent Institutes; (ii) CTEVT affiliated Community Institutes; and (iii) Community School Annex Programs (CSAP). Participating institutions selected following due process12 will receive the MG in installments upon completion of and duly endorsed by the duly formed governing bodies the Institutional Plan/Strategic Plan (SP) of respective institutions. 2. Participating institutions will receive MG in installments: (i) As an incentive grant, institutions will receive 1st installment (10% of the Annual Work Plan and Budget of the fiscal year) upon receiving the institutions commitment of 5% and a credible funding plan for the tasks envisioned under the MG. Subsequent, installments will be released upon approval13 of the claims submitted by respective institutions against completed tasks defined in the AWPB. Performance Grants (PG) 3. Four types of technical institutes are eligible for PG: the three types of above stated institutes eligible for MG and CTEVT affiliated Private Institutes. The Consultations agreed on 11 performance indicators (see Table below) under 3 different categories: (i) quality and efficiency - 4 indicators; (ii) equity – 3 indicators; and (iii) expansion and innovation – 4 indicators. 4. To consider the scale/size of the CSAPs, which are smaller compared to CTEVT Constituent and Affiliated Institutions and also to further promote the community contribution envisioned by the government in the design of CSAPs, unit rate of items for CSAPs in Table 1 is double the amount for CTEVT Constituent and Affiliated Institutions. Similarly, to consider the characteristics of CTEVT Private Institutes compared to Constituent and Community ones, four performance indicators14 were agreed not to be applicable for private institutions. 5. Consideration of lagging Regions. The grant in Table 1 below will be multiplied by a Human Development Index (HDI) Factor (HDIF) of the district the participating institutions. HDIF = (National average HDI)/ (HDI of the District of the participating institution) but should not be less than 1 and more than 1.5. For practical purposes HDIF (standardized) will be used from Table 2 below.  12  The process has been defined in the Implementation Guidelines. PS approved 1st five claims will be prior-reviewed by the Bank; other claims/installments will be post reviewed following Bank’s procurement procedures. 14 The four performance indicators CTEVT affiliated private institutions will not receive PG are: (i) New Program in TSLC; (ii) New program in Diploma; (iii) New innovative program in TSLC; (iv) New innovative program in Diploma. 13  26  Table 1: Performance Indicators (to be refined further) No  Performance Indicator  Quality and efficiency 1 First round of tracer study completed 2 Pass rate  3  4  Student Counseling and placement cell in place and functioning15 Institute – Industry linkage cell established and functioning16  Equity 5 Share of students 6  7  Unit  Per unit per Capita Grant, NRP  Quantity  Grant Amount, NPR  Batch  12,000  1  4,80,000  Up to 60% = 1200; 60%-80% 1800; 805%-100% =2400  Share of students from disadvantaged Janjatis  960,000 1,440,00 +20 % point  1,920,000  Cell  1  600,000  Not per capita  Cell  1  600,000  Not per capita  960,000  Not applicable for Nursing, CMA and AHA  girls  Share of students from Dalits  Remarks  %  %  Up to30% =1200; 30%50% =2400; Up to 10% =1,200; 10%20% =2400; 20%-30% = 3600 Up to 20% =1,200; 20%30% =2,400; 30%-40% = 3,600  +20 % point 1,9200,000 480,000 +10 % point 960,000 1,440,000 480,000 +10 % point 960,000 1,440,000  Expansion and innovation  15  Grant will be released in 3 installments: 1st installment (20%) will be released after the cell is duly established and its regulatory framework/guidelines in place; 2nd installment (40%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report of 1 st round student counseling; 3rd installment (40%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report of 2nd round student counseling. 16 Grant will be released in 3 installments; 1st installment (20%) will be released after the cell is duly established and its regulatory framework/guidelines in place; 2nd installment (30%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report of 1 st round institute-industry dialogue; 3rd installment (40%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report during the last 1 to 2 years..  27  No  Performance Indicator  8  New Program in TSLC17 New program in Diploma18 New innovative program in TSLC19 New innovative program in Diploma20  9 10  11  Unit  Per unit per Capita Grant, NRP  Quantity  Grant Amount, NPR 6,00,000 1,200,000  Remarks  Not per capita; not applicable for private institutions  800,000  1,600,000  Table 2: District Human Development Indices Districts  HDI  HDIF (Actual)  HDIF (Standar dized)  No.  Districts  HDI  HDIF (Actual)  HDIF (Standar dized)  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Sankhuwasabh a Solukhumbu Taplejung Bhojpur Dhankuta Ilam Khotang Okhaldhunga Panchthar Terhathum  0.481 0.479 0.467 0.472 0.507 0.521 0.442 0.481 0.484 0.523  0.979 0.983 1.009 0.998 0.929 0.904 1.066 0.979 0.973 0.901  1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.0  39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  0.492 0.454 0.467 0.593 0.492 0.498 0.486 0.504 0.535 0.524  0.9573 1.0374 1.0086 0.7943 0.9573 0.9458 0.9691 0.9345 0.8804 0.8989  1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0  11  Udaypur  0.488  0.965  1.0  49  0.437  1.0778  1.1  12  Jhapa  0.494  0.953  1.0  50  0.482  0.9772  1.0  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  Morang Saptari Siraha Sunsari Dolakha Rasuwa Sindhupalchok Dhading KavrePalancho wk Makwanpur  0.531 0.453 0.427 0.5 0.45 0.394 0.414 0.41  0.887 1.040 1.103 0.942 1.047 1.195 1.138 1.149  1.0 1.0 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.2 1.1 1.1  51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58  Baglung Gorkha Gulmi Kaski Lamjung Myagdi Palpa Parbat Syangja Tanahun Kapilbast u Nawalpar asi Rupandeh i Dolpa Humla Jumla Kalikot Mugu Dailekh Jajarkot  0.546 0.371 0.367 0.348 0.322 0.304 0.381 0.343  0.8626 1.2695 1.2834 1.3534 1.4627 1.5493 1.2362 1.3732  1.0 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.2 1.4  0.543 0.479  0.867 0.983  1.0 1.0  59 60  Pyuthan Rolpa  0.416 0.384  1.1322 1.2266  1.1 1.2  No .  21 22 17  Grants will be released in 3 installments: 1st installment (20%) after enrollment of 1st batch students; 2nd installment (30%) once the batch appears in the first exam; 3rd installment once the batch appears in the final exams. 18 .

Scholarship Recipients The interaction focused on notification of scholarship opportunity, selection process, notification of scholarship recipients, registration and verification process of scholarship recipients, opening of bank account of each recipient, dispatch money in each students account, conditions for scholarship, use of scholarship, and students’ feelings and reactions on scholarship. Key Findings        Students received information about the availability of scholarships mostly through their schools and also from newspapers and friends and relatives. After notification students opened bank account in Rastriya Banijya Bank, signed the Scholarship Bond Paper (most of them signed the bond without reading the conditions that applied to their maintaining their eligibility status). The school authorities were handling the check books in one training center and the PS has been asked to correct this immediately. Most students chose to undertake the TSLC/Diploma because of the scholarship; otherwise they would have chosen other subjects of study. A few would have not undertaken any further studies. Most students said they would look for work after completing their course of study. For effective communication and outreach, the students suggested that use of the local FM Radio (morning, news time, evening), Kantipur (national daily), and notice through schools would be effective.  B. Training of Trainers (Master Trainers, Lead Trainers, Assistant Trainers) In the meeting the discussion focused on how trainees got the notice of training, their motivation to apply, overall management of training and classroom instruction, the quality and adequacy of trainers, training curriculum, trainees’ assessment and instructional materials. In addition, trainees were asked about their own assessment of differences in their knowledge, skill and attitude before and after the training. Key Findings       Master Trainers learnt about the availability of this training through newspaper and website of EVENT, CTEVT and MOE while lead trainers and assistant trainers got information mostly from friends and newspapers. TOT trainees were selected through very competitive entrance tests. They were motivated because TOT has a good market in various fields including technical education and vocational training, and TITI has a very good reputation. The curriculum was relevant and adequate; instructional materials and presentation techniques were friendly, and delivery in the classroom was impressive. In every lesson there were two trainers in the classroom. There were qualified experts, resource persons, and technical assistants that made instruction, interesting and enjoyable. The specific learning from these trainings were instructional material preparation, use of instructional materials, presentation skills, micro-teaching for self assessment, motivation techniques, one on one coaching, correcting trainees’ home work, competency based individualized learning, questioning techniques, writing skills, active listening, time management, and so on. 30      Trainees found a big difference before and after the training among themselves. The differences were found in their knowledge of TOT and rigorous time management skills. Trainers’ attendance, discipline with regard to trainees’ attendance, reward for good performance and continuous assessment were also appreciated. Recommendations made by trainees included: (a) learning content was interesting but time was too short, (b) equalize per diem amounts for Master Trainers, Lead Trainers and Assistant Trainers.  C. Training of Assessors (Skill Test Assessors and Skill Test Managers) In the meeting the discussion focused on how trainees got the notice of training, their motivation to apply, overall management of training and classroom instruction, the quality and adequacy of trainers, training curriculum, trainees’ assessment and instructional materials. In addition, trainees were asked about their own assessment of differences in their knowledge, skill and attitude before and after the training. Key Findings          Trainees got information from people they knew, newspapers, websites and local FM radios. Technical professionals were motivated to join to enhance their professional skills, sharpen their technical expertise, and to be able to take up the opportunity go to different parts of the country. Some said that being involved in skill test activities would also give them the opportunity for marketing their business as well. Some trainees applied through e-mail that made them easy and got reply of their selection by email. Previously, some of the trainees had been employed as assessors based on their professional experience. After this training, the trainees said they were able to conduct skill test in a more organized and systematic way. They now also knew what technical competency was; and how competency levels were used in a real job at the workplace. In every lesson there were two trainers in the classroom. There were qualified experts, resource persons, and technical assistants that made instruction easy. Every minute was interesting and enjoyable. Time keeping was very strict for both trainers and trainees. Three days time was enough for training. Training allowances, lunch and training management was good.  31  ANNEX 6  Area of work  Issues  Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) (Updated in July 2012) Risks Actions to address the risks Responsi Timeline Early ble warning agency signs  Status of implementati on  Organizational arrangements Coordinatio n in project implementa tion  Weak collaboration  between GoN agencies, sometimes, to overlapping responsibilities  The Coordination Committee will meet bi- MOE annually to achieve better communication and coordination among all project entities.    Interdepartmental cooperation between participating GoN agencies  The Project Implementation MOE Committee representing all project entities will ensure effective communications on a regular basis.

Introduction  1. An IDA education team1 for Nepal carried out the second Project Implementation Support Consultations (ISC) for the Enhanced Vocational Education and Training Project (EVENT) from July 25 to August 6, 2012. 2. ISC Objectives: The objectives of the consultations were to review implementation progress on the following: (i) project components, implementation arrangements and quality of implementation in terms of human resources, processes and timeliness of activities; (ii) activities related to the project’s Disbursement Linked Indicators; (iii) disbursement of grants to scholarship recipient students, and management of scholarship student database; (iv) implementation of performance and matching grant programs, (v) implementation of short-term training programs; (vi) communication and outreach activities; (vii) establishment and functioning of a monitoring and evaluation system for the project; and (viii) progress made on actions agreed in the first review consultations. The consultations also reviewed governance, financial management, procurement, social safeguards and environmental aspects of the project. Key issues were identified, agreements reached, and an action plan prepared describing the next steps to be undertaken to speed up project implementation. 3. The IDA team met with senior officials of the Government of Nepal (GON), including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the National Planning Commission (NPC), Ministry of Education (MOE), the Council of Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT), the National Skills Testing Board (NSTB), Training Institute for Technical Instruction (TITI), Student Financial Assistance Fund Development Board (SFAFDB), and Employment Fund (EF). The team also held focus group discussions with EVENT scholarship recipients, and graduates of the lead, assistant and master trainer training programs and the skills test assessor and manager training program funded by EVENT. The team would like to thank all the officials of the institutions visited, and the EVENT Project Secretariat for organizing the ISC meetings and visits, and for their cooperation and hospitality. 4. This Aide Memoire reports on consultations findings and recommendations, and agreements reached on next steps vis-a-vis the above objectives. This Aide-Memoire was discussed at pre- wrapup meetings with the Ministry of Education on August 5, 2012 and with the National Planning Commission on August 6, 2012. A wrap-up meeting was held with the Ministry of Finance on August 6, 2012. 5. As agreed with the MOF, this aide-memoire will be classified as a public document under the World Bank's Access to Information Policy.  1  Saurav Dev Bhatta (co-TTL, Senior Education Specialist), Sangeeta Goyal (co-TTL, Senior Economist), Mohan Prasad Aryal (Operations Officer), Venkatesh Sundararaman (Senior Economist), Uddhav Kumar Bhandari (Economist), Jayakrishna Upadhaya (Research Analyst), Bigyan Pradhan (Senior Financial Management Specialist), Nagendra Nakarmi (FM Assistant), Kiran Ranjan Baral (Senior Procurement Specialist), Shambhu Prasad Upreti (Procurement Specialist), Hiramani Ghimire (Senior Governance Specialist), Bandita Sijapati (Social Development, Consultant), Drona Raj Ghimire (Environmental Specialist), and Agni Kafle (TVET specialist, Consultant). Sushila Rai (Program Assistant) provided all the logistical support for these consultations.  1  II.  Key Achievements    Hundred and sixty percent of the FY 2011/12 target for the training of master trainers (DLI 2) and 100% of the target for the training of lead and assistant trainers (DLI 1) were met.    Eighty four percent of the FY 2011/12 target for the training of skills test assessors (DLI 3) and 72% of the target for the training of skills test managers (DLI 4) were met. These results were achieved in a period of five months, compensating for the delay in project start-up.    Scholarship candidates from Technical School Leaving Certificate (TSLC) programs have received 100% of the payment for FY 2011/12.    A total of 87 firms have been shortlisted to provide results-based short-term training to 7,500 beneficiaries. The evaluation of their technical and financial proposals is nearing completion.    A total of 4,132 candidates (103% of the annual target in the Results Framework) were tested for the Recognition of Prior Learning.    Arrangements have been made for third party verification of the DLI outputs 1-4 through the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program.    The verification of DLI outputs 1-4 will be done jointly by the PS and IDA as an exception for FY 2011/12 and will be completed by September 31, 2012.    The Financial Management Information System (FMIS) is fully operational. The programs are almost ready for the project Management Information System (MIS) but the software for the server is yet to arrive.    The Implementation Progress Report (IPR), including the Financial Management Report (FMR), for the second trimester (FY 2011/12) was submitted on time and has been approved.    Total disbursement as of July 28, 2012 is USD 6.79 million (13.58% of total IDA financing). III.  Critical Issues and Challenges affecting Implementation  Critical issues and challenges that need to be effectively addressed to ensure that the gains from key achievements are sustained and further implementation progresses in a timely manner include inter alia:   Establishment of a comprehensive and effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) system for short-term training. The training will commence once the M & E system is in place.    Timely selection of short-term training providers, and the delivery of short-term training within the current fiscal year (FY 2012/13). Two rounds of selection and training delivery are planned.    Timely signing of MoUs between the PS, TITI, and CTEVT, and between the PS, NSTB and CTEVT for the delivery of targets specified in Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLI) 1-4 for FY 2012/13.    Timely signing of an MoU between the PS and CTEVT for the delivery of targets specified in DLIs 5-7. 2    Timely initiation of an intensive media and information dissemination campaign to ensure that potential beneficiaries of EVENT scholarship know about and apply for scholarships in the next round.    Timely completion of scholarship candidate selection for FY 2012/13.    Finalization of performance criteria for grants to public and private TSLC/Diploma training institutions.    The establishment of a functional MIS by the end of August, 2012.    Hiring of individual consultants for the PS Technical Team by October 15, 2012.    Submission of updated procurement plan for FY 2012/13 by the end of August 2012.  IV.  Component-wise Implementation Progress, Issues and Recommendations  6. Project Development Objective: The Project Development Objective is to expand the supply of skilled and employable labor by increasing access to quality training programs, and by strengthening the technical and vocational education and training system in Nepal. 7. The project consists of the following four components: (1) Strengthening TEVT Regulatory Activities and Capacity Building; (2) Strengthening Technical Education; (3) Support for Short-Term Training and Recognition of Prior Learning; and (4) Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. Component 1: Strengthening TEVT Regulatory Activities and Capacity Building 8. This component focuses on the regulatory environment and institutional resources available to the TEVT sector to draw upon for current functioning and future development. Disbursements under this component are results-based and linked to specific outputs and milestones for each activity supported. 9. In spite of a delay in project start-up, very good progress has been made towards the achievement of targets for DLIs 1-4. As summarized in Table 1, the FY 2011/122 target for the training of master trainers (DLI 2) has been exceeded by 60%; and 100% of the target for the training of lead and assistant trainers (DLI 1) has been met. Although the targets for the remaining two DLIs have not been fully met, the progress should be considered satisfactory considering that the MoU between the PS and NSTB for the achievement of DLIs 3 and 4 was signed only five months ago3.  2  The DLI achievements are for FY2011/12 for reimbursement after verification in FY2012/13. The MoU between the EVENT PS and NSTB for the training of skills test assessors (DLI 3) and managers (DLI 4) was signed on February 26, 2012. Similarly, the MoU between the EVENT PS and TITI for the training of master trainers and lead/assistant trainers was signed on January 19, 2012. The training for all four categories of trainees was conducted by TITI. 3  3  Table 1: Achievement of targets for DLIs 1-4 DLI description  FY 2011/12 FY 2011/12 % of target target achievement achieved DLI 1: Number of lead and assistant 200 200 100% trainers trained DLI 2: Number of master trainers trained 25 40 160% DLI 3: Number of skills test assessors 1,250 1,050 84% trained DLI 4: Number of skills test managers 100 72 72% trained 10. During the course of the consultations, the joint review team held discussions with groups of lead and assistant trainers, master trainers, skills test assessors and skills test managers trained by TITI as part of the EVENT project. The training graduates were unanimous in their view that the training was of high quality in terms of management, content and delivery. 11. The PS has met the minimum targets for DLIs 1-4 for the year 2011-12. Reimbursements for the achievement of DLI targets 1-4 will be made by IDA after the PS submits its achievement report and IDA independently verifies the outputs. Because of a delay in the selection of an appropriate organization to carry out the third party verification, it has been agreed that the verification of outputs for DLIs 1-4 for FY 2011/12 will be done jointly by IDA and the PS ‘as an exception.’ Starting FY 2012/13, the verification will be done by a third party. Arrangements have been made for third party verification of these DLI outputs through the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program. The joint verification of outputs for FY 2011/12 will be completed by September 31, 2012. 12. For each fiscal year, IDA disbursements will be made independently for each DLI according to the outputs achieved. For each DLI, a minimum of 50% of the annual target must be achieved for any disbursement to be made for that year. However, if the achievement is below 50%, the outputs from the following year(s) can be used to make up for the shortfall. 13. The preparation of the MoU between the PS and CTEVT for strengthening the CTEVT affiliation system (DLI 5), strengthening the CTEVT examination system (DLI 6) and scaling up the Training Management Information System or the CTEVT TMIS (DLI 7) has been delayed, and now is undergoing revision to be signed and made operational in this fiscal year. It has been agreed that the MoU will be submitted by the PS to IDA for review and clearance by August 15, 2012, and the MoU will be signed between the two parties by September 30, 2012. The plan for developing/revising 20 TSLC and Diploma level courses may be included as part of the same MoU. 14. For the next cycle of DLIs 1-4 for FY 2012/13, it has been agreed that the PS will submit the MoUs that need to be signed between the PS, CTEVT and TITI for DLIs 1-2, and the PS, CTEVT and NSTB for DLIs 3-4, to IDA for review and clearance by August 12, 2012, and complete the signature process by August 25, 2012. IDA strongly recommends that the time-line agreed to be adhered to so that the momentum gained in the achievement of these DLI outputs is maintained, and there are no gaps in the transition from the first cycle to the next. Component 2: Strengthening Technical Education 15. This component focuses on strengthening technical education at the Technical School Leaving Certificate (TSLC) and Diploma levels provided by CTEVT constituent and affiliated institutions, 4  and Community School Annex Programs (CSAPs) by providing Matching Grants 4, and Performance Grants5 on a competitive basis6 (see Annex 4 for details). 16. Matching Grant: IDA has cleared guidelines for the selection of TSLC and Diploma training institutions, including the distribution mechanisms of these grants to institutions, subject to the PS incorporating comments provided. LOI for matching grants for the first round has been published and the last date for receiving applications is August 4, 2012. Short-listing of eligible institutions for the first round is expected to be completed by August 18, 2012. Call for LOIs for matching grants for the second round will be published by August 31, 2012. Between October 15 and November 1, 2012, selection of institutions from both rounds of calls for proposals will be completed. Performance Grant: The PS has shared an initial draft of guidelines for selection of private TSLC and Diploma training institutions for performance grants. Institutions selected for support under matching grants are automatically eligible to receive funds under performance grants. The PS still needs to finalize the mechanism for distributing performance grants to the selected institutions. During the consultations, 11 performance indicators under 3 different categories were agreed upon: (i) quality and efficiency – 4 indicators: (ii) equity – 3 indicators; and (iii) expansion and innovation – 4 indicators (see Annex 4). Indicators and formulae for computing performance grant amounts for supported institutions will be piloted and finalized by August 15, 2012. It was agreed that the PS will share the updated draft of the guidelines with IDA for review and clearance by August 31, 2012, and publish call for proposals from private affiliated institutions by September 15, 2012. 17. CTEVT affiliated eligible community technical institutions can also compete for matching and performance grants but the criteria for defining these institutions need to be clarified. During the consultations, criteria developed by CTEVT for the purpose were discussed. It was agreed that these criteria would be finalized after further discussion, that the final criteria should not conflict with those GON has already developed for community higher education institutions for public funding. 18. Scholarships for TSLC and Diploma students (FY 2011/2012): Of the targeted 1,104 scholarship recipients for the FY 2011/12, 904 (730 TSLC and 174 Diploma) were selected and have received the first and second installments (through Rashtriya Banijya Bank Limited). 19. Scholarships for TSLC and Diploma students (FY 2012/13): The Proxy Means Targeting (PMT) mechanism is being used to select this cohort of students. Tasks have been divided amongst the PS and SFAFDB through an MoU: the PS is responsible for information outreach and media campaign throughout the country and SFAFDB is mandated for timely distribution and collection of filled PMT forms from applicants, data entry and category-wise short-listing of applicants. The final selection will be done by the PS itself. Due to delays in signing the MoU and extension of the application submission deadline, selection of beneficiaries could not be completed before the students took CTEVT entrance exams as agreed earlier (to generate the largest pool of applicants for the scholarships as possible). Important tasks that still remain to be carried out before final selection are: a. verifying from the applicant database whether or not applicants have passed the CTEVT entrance exams; and b. field verification of information for at least 10% of applications. It was agreed that the PS will publish the list of scholarship recipients for FY2012/13 by October 30, 2012, and sign the participation agreements with selected candidates by December 15, 2012.  4  Three types of technical institutes eligible for Matching Grant: (i) CTEVT Constituent Institutes; (ii) CTEVT affiliated Community Institutes; and (iii) Community School Annex Programs. 5 Four types of technical institutes eligible for Performance Grant: (i) three types of institutes eligible for MG; and (ii) CTEVT affiliated Private Institutes. 6 Each type of institutions will compete among themselves to qualify for the grants.  5  Component 3: Supporting Short-Term Vocational Training and Recognition of Prior Learning 20. This component supports short term vocational training and the certification of technical and vocational skills acquired through informal means. Short-term Training 21. The project targets for short-term training for FY 2012/13 under the voucher-based and results-based financing modalities were 1,000 and 7,500 beneficiaries, respectively. While short-term training has not yet been launched, letters of intent (LOIs) from potential training providers have been received and evaluated by the PS for both modalities. 22. In the case of results-based short-term training, 87 firms were shortlisted from a pool of 170 that submitted LOIs, and were asked to submit their technical and financial proposals to the PS. Among the 170 applicants, training providers that met the project’s eligibility criteria (95 in total) were given Rapid Market Appraisal (RMA) training before the short-listing was done. The RMA training was conducted jointly by the PS and the Employment Fund (EF), utilizing the latter’s expertise and experience in RMA training. The evaluation of the technical and financial proposals for the 87 firms is nearing completion. These firms will be contracted to train a total of 7,500 beneficiaries during FY2012/13 for meeting the target from the previous year. 23. The PS has proposed a target of 11,000 beneficiaries for FY2012/13. It therefore plans to publish another call for LOIs for results-based short-term training after the launch of the first round. 24. As there will be over 900 short-term training events during FY 2012/13 alone, and each training event requires 4-5 monitoring visits7, a comprehensive and effective M & E system for short-term training must be in place before any short-term training is launched. In order to set up such a system in a timely manner, the PS has proposed a joint monitoring mechanism with EF whereby their existent extensive regional monitoring infrastructure, experience, and expertise can be utilized to effectively monitor short-term training under EVENT without any significant cost. The PS can also make use of resources of the MoE at the central, regional and local levels in the process The PIC will make a decision on the setting up of an appropriate M & E system by August 10, 2012. IDA will provide its no-objection for carrying out short-term training activities under this component once a sound M & E system is in place. 25. One issue raised by CTEVT and the PS during the consultations was the need to allow CTEVT constituent schools to provide short-term training under the project. It has been agreed that IDA and the PS will further discuss how this can be accomplished. Recognition of Prior Learning 26. Altogether 4,132 youth from 72 districts were tested for recognition of prior learning (RPL) in 38 centers across the nation. The certification process is on-going and is expected to be completed by September 2012. The advertisement for the next round of RPL will be published by November 15, 2012.  7  As each training event has an average class size of 20, there will be approximately 925 training events (18500 beneficiaries/20 beneficiaries per event) during FY 2013/14.  6  Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation Project Management: 27. The PS will finalize the Terms of Reference (TORs) and complete the hiring of the technical team consisting of individual consultants – procurement, Financial Management (FM) and M & E by September 2012. The PS has hired one media expert for developing communications strategies for the project. Given the increasing need for enhanced outreach, the TORs for this position need to be reviewed to cover a wider mandate. 28. Finalization of Project Implementation Manual: As also suggested during the last consultations, the PS will prepare two simplified guidelines in Nepali targeted towards the beneficiaries – one for scholarships or stipends and the other for users of Category 1 activities8. The work is already in progress and the PS aims to complete these by September 15, 2012. 29. Project website9: The PS has been advised to regularly update the project website and to upload all project documents including the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Project Implementation Manual (PIM), the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), guidelines prepared for various activities, advertisements for applications, aide-memoires etc. As much as possible, Nepali versions of the documents should also be prepared and uploaded. 30. Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E): The second trimester Implementation Progress Report [November 2011-March, 2012] has been submitted by the PS to IDA. It has been reviewed and approved by IDA. An update on the Results Agreement is provided in Annex 2. Component-wise Progress of the M & E System 31. Component 1: The monitoring forms and manuals for DLIs 1-4 have been developed. The monitoring tools and system for the remaining 3 DLIs will be developed after the MoU with CTEVT has been signed. Third party monitoring and verification of the outputs for DLIs 1-4 will be done by the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program. The joint verification of outputs for FY 2011/12 will be completed by September 31, 2012 32. Component 2: The PS is working on the monitoring tools, their manual and guidelines for this component. For PMT based scholarship to TSLC and Diploma students, the M & E tools for all stages of student selection processes (information dissemination, forms distribution and collection, data-entry, field verification, stipend distribution and student enrollment and attendance) have been finalized. While many of these forms could not be used this year as activities were already completed by the time the forms were developed, they will be used for the next round of student selection for scholarship support. Baseline data from institutions will be collected once they have signed the participation agreements (contracts/MoUs) with the PS. 33. Component 3: While the tools for monitoring both short-term training and RPL activities have been developed, an appropriate M & E system for short-term training is not yet in place. As the training will take place across many districts, the PS needs to quickly decide how to establish such a mechanism so as not to delay the launch of this activity. Baseline data from institutions will be collected once they have signed the participation agreements (contracts/MoUs) with the PS. 8  “Category” means a category set forth in the table in Section IV of Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement for the EVENT project between GON and IDA. 9 www.event.gov.np  7  34. Component 4: A formal MoU has been signed between the Employment Fund (EF)10 and EVENT to share knowledge and experience. Through this MoU, EF has provided pro-bono technical support to EVENT in the area of short-term training including conducting Rapid Market Appraisal training. The Project has also taken the EF electronic management information system (MIS) and adapted and expanded it to develop a comprehensive Project MIS for EVENT. 35. Programs for the MIS have been written but the server is not yet ready. The MIS consultant has completed developing formats for DLIs 1-4 under component one, all stages of the student selection processes (information dissemination, form distribution and collection, data-entry, field verification, stipend distribution and student enrollment and attendance) under component 2, and short-term training and certification of prior learning. A system of evaluation based on the monitoring tools and information fed in by end users received at the PS is being finalized. V.  Procurement  36. Project procurement planning and implementation status of the approved procurement plan has been satisfactory. Project procurement includes procurement of goods, services and non-consulting services. With regard to the implementation of the approved procurement plan, procurement of the activities under goods has met their target within the schedule or with some delay. Progress under the procurement of consulting and non-consulting services is only around 70%. The PS shared that the main reason for this was the delay in signing the MoU between the PS and CTEVT and between the PS and the Department of Labor. Short-term training is provided in both CTEVT constituent public and affiliated private training institutions. During the meetings, it has been agreed that the PS and IDA will have discussions on how CTEVT constituent schools can participate in the provision of short-term training under the project. It was also agreed that building on the experience gained by the Project and other agencies in conducting similar trainings, an appropriate method for selecting training providers will be worked out and based on all this an updated procurement plan for FY 2012/13 will be prepared and submitted to IDA by the end of August, 2012. VI.  Financial Management and Disbursement  37. Budget for FY2011/12 and Estimated Expenditures: The budget for EVENT is allocated under the budget head 3,501,353 (Recurrent) and 3,501,354 (Capital). Total budget of NRs.596.80 million (eqv. USD 7.20 million) has been allocated under Recurrent (NRs.479.70 million) and Capital (NRs.117.10 million). The review team noted that all anomalies in the budget as noted during the last review have now been corrected. Total estimated expenditures for FY2011/12 are only NRs.120.67 million, which is only about 20.2% of the approved budget. Of this, total recurrent expenditures were NRs.105.61 million or 22% o the approved Recurrent Budget and total capital expenditures were NRs.15.06 million or 12.9% of the approved Capital Budget. This indicates that the implementation during FY2011/12 was very slow. 38. Retroactive Financing. There is a retroactive financing provision in the legal agreement for expenditures incurred on or after May 16, 2011 under Categories 3 and 4. The review team confirmed that there are no retroactive financing incurred. 39. Budget for FY2012/13. Due to political situation affected by the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the government was not able to announce the annual work program and full budget for 10  The Employment Fund , which has extensive experience in short-term training, is guided by a steering committee chaired by the Joint Secretary of Planning at MoE. It also implements the IDA-funded Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative (AGEI) project.  8  FY2012/13. According to the decision of the government, only one third of previous year’s expenditures have been approved to be programmed for the first trimester. EVENT is preparing the work program and budget based on this decision. No major development expenditures will incur during the first trimester. The review team suggested to include the committed program and related expenditures in the work program and provide with appropriate justification if this exceeds the ceiling based one one-third expenditures of the previous fiscal year. 40. Disbursements. Total disbursement as of July 28, 2012 is USD 6.79 million drawn from IDA Grant as the initial deposit to the Designated Accounts. The Project has not drawn any funds from the categories. Key reasons for no disbursements are slow start up of the Project and delay in compliance with disbursement conditions. The second trimester Implementation Progress Report which includes Financial Monitoring Report has recently been approved, and it has not called for any documentation of expenditures nor required any further advance to the Designated Account. The review team noted that there has been some progress in the achievement of DLI 1 to 4, and upon independent verification and certification of the outputs achieved, some disbursement is expected under Category 1. 41. Disbursement Condition. There is a disbursement condition that relates to Category 1 and 2. Preparation of the Project Implementation Manual acceptable to IDA and adoption of the Manual is the disbursement condition in order to implement activities and disbursements incurred under these two categories. The disbursement condition for Category 2 was lifted in March 2012. Somehow lifting the disbursement condition for Category 1 was missed during this time, which was noted during this review. During the review period, IDA lifted the disbursement condition for Category 1. 42. Financial Management Action Plan. The review team reviewed the implementation of FM Action Plan as agreed during negotiations. Due to delay in project start up, there has been a slippage in a few actions. The review team discussed and agreed new time line for these actions, which are as follows: a. Finance Staff. There is an agreement that one Finance Officer and one Accountant would be put in place in the Project Secretariat by May 30, 2011. The Accountant is already in place, and the position of Finance Officer has been created. However, the Finance Officer position has yet to be filled. If there is a further delay in getting the Finance Officer in place, the Project agreed to use a temporary staff for this work, and also recruit a short-term consultant to provide support to the Project. In addition to provide financial management support to the project, the consultant will also play a key role in monitoring the financial management status of the beneficiaries of the Project. The Project agreed to share the terms of reference of the consultant with IDA for comments. The Project aimed to have the consultant on board by September 2012. The review team reminded the government the clause under Schedule 2, para 2 (d) of the Financing Agreement which specifies that critical staff will not be transferred until the completion of the Project. b. Computerized Financial Management Information System (FMIS). The review team noted that the FMIS is now operational. The whole financial transaction is now entered in the FMIS and all reports are generated through the system. 43. Financial Management. The project team has made good efforts in maintaining books of accounts as required by the government system. The review team noted that the books of accounts are all upto-date. The Project has now begun to deface the invoices with the PAID stamp after the payments are made. Internal audit has not taken place.  9  44. Implementation Progress Report: There are no outstanding implementation progress reports. The second trimester report for FY2011/12 has been received and approved. No progress is observed from the financial report of the second trimester. It did not warrant for any documentation or for any further advance. The review team reminded that the third trimester report of FY2011/12 is due on August 31, 2012. 45. Audit Report: The first unaudited report that will be required is for FY2011/12 which is due on October 15, 2012. The review team also reminded that the first audited report is for FY2011/12 which is due on January 15, 2013. VII.  Environmental Management and Social Safeguards  46. Environmental Management: The PS has prepared Matching Grant operational Guidelines, Performance Grant Operational Guidelines and Short-Term Training Guidelines. These Guidelines, inter alia, also contain environmental provisions. It was agreed that Chapter 3 of the ESMF will be provided as an annex in these guidelines. During the previous consultations, it was agreed that the trimester Implementation Progress Report (IPR) of the project will contain information regarding environmental safeguard activities. As of now, no subproject proposals for civil works have been received by the PS. 47. There have been delays in the following actions from the previous consultations for which new completion dates have been agreed: a) While the ESMF has been finalized it is yet to be translated into Nepali. It was agreed that the final English version of the ESMF will be uploaded on the project website and disseminated to potential partner institutions immediately; ESMF will be translated into Nepali by August 31, 2012, and disseminated by September 2012; b) during the orientation workshop for partner institutions, the ESMF provisions and requirements were not covered. It was agreed that in all forthcoming orientations, there will be one dedicated session on the ESMF; and c) although the IPR reports on environmental safeguards status, supervision report does not. It was agreed that supervision report now onward also cover environmental status. 48. During the consultations, the six-monthly environmental management status report to be prepared by the PS and the annual independent environmental compliance check were discussed. It was agreed that the PS will complete the necessary preparatory work for commissioning the latter soon. Considering the lack of environmental expertise within the PS, it was agreed that the PS will maintain a roster of qualified environmental specialists for obtaining their short-term services as and when required. As during the previous consultations, the IDA team reiterated their advice to the PS to coordinate with the Department of Education’s environmental engineer on matters related to environmental management in EVENT. 49. Social Safeguards: IDA has noted satisfactory progress made by the PS relating to social issues. In the previous year, the Proxy Means Test (PMT) method could not be used to select candidates for scholarships but an agreement has now been signed with SFAFDB to take this process forward. During the FY 2068/69, there were 904 TSLC/Diploma scholarships that were granted. Out of these, 445 recipients (49.2 percent) were girls. The PS has not yet analyzed the information on scholarship recipients along other dimensions of disadvantages such as caste/ethnicity, disability status, lagging regions, etc. It has been agreed that the PS will avail the disaggregated information to the IDA team by end-August 2012. 50. The IDA team also reviewed the ‘Matching Grant Operational Guide’ prepared for FY 2012/13, and has noted that incentive schemes for the vulnerable groups have been incorporated in accordance with the specifications contained in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for 10  the project. The team is also pleased to note that the media strategy developed for the project contains specific measures for targeting vulnerable groups in order to ensure that they are knowledgeable and aware of the scholarship schemes. 51. In terms of safeguards, the review team noted a few inconsistencies in the EMSF, PIM and PAD, that needs to be corrected before the final version of the ESMF is publicized in the project website, translated and disseminated. These include different information on the age limits of the trainees, installments for short-term training, and information on land acquisition. The PS has agreed to make these changes immediately. 52. The PIM also includes provisions for social screening of potential projects prior to inviting full subproject proposals. The PS has not yet developed a checklist or a template for social screening. The IDA team has recommended, and the PS has agreed that a checklist for social screening that is akin to the Environmental Screening Checklist will be developed by end-August 2012. 53. Monitoring and Reporting: The PS has agreed that the MIS for the project will incorporate disaggregated information along the various dimensions of vulnerability that the project seeks to address (e.g., gender, caste, ethnicity, lagging regions, etc.). 54. The IPR and supervision related reviews for the project do not report on the implementation of social and environmental management issues on a regular basis. The PS has agreed to incorporate them from now onwards even if there are no major issues to be reported. 55. Finally, the IDA team has noted that a Grievance Redress Mechanism provisioned for in the ESMF has not yet been institutionalized effectively. The project website includes provisions for ‘feedback’ and other types of complaints are handled by project officials as and when people come to the project office to complain. The PS has agreed to formalize the GRM by putting up a ‘Suggestion Box’ in the project office, starting a Complaint Register, and designating a staff to handle complaints/grievances by end-August 2012. VIII.  Governance  56. The Coordination Committee (CC), Project Implementation Committee (PIC), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and PS have been constituted as per agreement. Clear terms of reference for the CC, PIC, TAC and all PS staff have been prepared and have received clearance from IDA. CTEVT is represented in the CC and PIC, and leads the TAC. The CC which is not a project specific entity but responsible for all vocational activities across the Government has yet to meet. There has been considerable delay in the passage of NSTB, one of the key implementation partners of EVENT, byelaws (original agreed date April 21, 2011) with implications for the project’s agreed action on granting greater autonomy to NSTB. Apart from the project action, the recently adopted TEVT policy of the Government foresees more autonomy to NSTB. This needs therefore to be expedited. The CTEVT has agreed to pass the bye-laws by September 30, 2012. 57. The project must have a strong monitoring system. Among other things, the Project should engage third-party monitors in verifying selected project activities, to assess the correctness of information submitted by individual beneficiaries and supported training providers. CARTA has been contracted to carry out independent monitoring services for DLI 1-4 outputs, which is encouraging. With the start of selecting short-term training providers from the private sector who will be conducting more than 900 training events across more than 20 districts, the project’s monitoring capacity needs to enhance significantly, especially at the local level. Among options available to the PS, is the possibility of engaging the Employment Fund to monitor project activities. The EF has technical 11  expertise and experience in the area of short-term vocational training and is already present in all five development regions and working with them could be more efficient and cost-effective than adding staff to the PS. Each short-term training event needs to be monitored at different stages from the selection and enrollment of trainees, delivery of training, testing and certification of trainees and their job placement. From a governance and accountability perspective short-term training should not be launched before a sound M & E system is in place. 58. The project is committed to developing and publishing service standards for contract management, scholarship process and inter-agency coordination so that the quality of delivery could be assessed against these standards. Work in this area, however, has not started yet. The project’s grievance handling system needs to be managed more systematically. This has been an ad hoc exercise so far. For example, the project received some complaints on scholarship and PMT; they have been resolved through dialogue with complainants. Going forward, two steps would be important. First, a system should be in place to handle grievances with mechanisms to track progress. Second, information on the system should be disseminated widely so that people know how to approach project authorities in case they are not happy about any aspect of the project. As an immediate improvement, EVENT website could offer some space for grievances, with a tracking system in place. 59. GAAP Implementation: Most GAAP actions are in progress, although they were delayed. The Project itself took some time to take off, which explains why many GAAP actions missed their original deadline. As part of the review, an updated GAAP (Annex 6) has been agreed with project participants. IX.  Next steps and agreed action plan  60. The agreed actions for the next trimester, and target completion dates are provided in Table 2 below. The next set of consultations/joint review is tentatively scheduled for January 2013.  12  Table 2: Agreed Action Plan (August – November, 2012) S. N.

Three types of technical institutes are eligible for MG: (i) CTEVT Constituent Institutes; (ii) CTEVT affiliated Community Institutes; and (iii) Community School Annex Programs (CSAP). Participating institutions selected following due process12 will receive the MG in installments upon completion of and duly endorsed by the duly formed governing bodies the Institutional Plan/Strategic Plan (SP) of respective institutions. 2. Participating institutions will receive MG in installments: (i) As an incentive grant, institutions will receive 1st installment (10% of the Annual Work Plan and Budget of the fiscal year) upon receiving the institutions commitment of 5% and a credible funding plan for the tasks envisioned under the MG. Subsequent, installments will be released upon approval13 of the claims submitted by respective institutions against completed tasks defined in the AWPB. Performance Grants (PG) 3. Four types of technical institutes are eligible for PG: the three types of above stated institutes eligible for MG and CTEVT affiliated Private Institutes. The Consultations agreed on 11 performance indicators (see Table below) under 3 different categories: (i) quality and efficiency - 4 indicators; (ii) equity – 3 indicators; and (iii) expansion and innovation – 4 indicators. 4. To consider the scale/size of the CSAPs, which are smaller compared to CTEVT Constituent and Affiliated Institutions and also to further promote the community contribution envisioned by the government in the design of CSAPs, unit rate of items for CSAPs in Table 1 is double the amount for CTEVT Constituent and Affiliated Institutions. Similarly, to consider the characteristics of CTEVT Private Institutes compared to Constituent and Community ones, four performance indicators14 were agreed not to be applicable for private institutions. 5. Consideration of lagging Regions. The grant in Table 1 below will be multiplied by a Human Development Index (HDI) Factor (HDIF) of the district the participating institutions. HDIF = (National average HDI)/ (HDI of the District of the participating institution) but should not be less than 1 and more than 1.5. For practical purposes HDIF (standardized) will be used from Table 2 below.  12  The process has been defined in the Implementation Guidelines. PS approved 1st five claims will be prior-reviewed by the Bank; other claims/installments will be post reviewed following Bank’s procurement procedures. 14 The four performance indicators CTEVT affiliated private institutions will not receive PG are: (i) New Program in TSLC; (ii) New program in Diploma; (iii) New innovative program in TSLC; (iv) New innovative program in Diploma. 13  26  Table 1: Performance Indicators (to be refined further) No  Performance Indicator  Quality and efficiency 1 First round of tracer study completed 2 Pass rate  3  4  Student Counseling and placement cell in place and functioning15 Institute – Industry linkage cell established and functioning16  Equity 5 Share of students 6  7  Unit  Per unit per Capita Grant, NRP  Quantity  Grant Amount, NPR  Batch  12,000  1  4,80,000  Up to 60% = 1200; 60%-80% 1800; 805%-100% =2400  Share of students from disadvantaged Janjatis  960,000 1,440,00 +20 % point  1,920,000  Cell  1  600,000  Not per capita  Cell  1  600,000  Not per capita  960,000  Not applicable for Nursing, CMA and AHA  girls  Share of students from Dalits  Remarks  %  %  Up to30% =1200; 30%50% =2400; Up to 10% =1,200; 10%20% =2400; 20%-30% = 3600 Up to 20% =1,200; 20%30% =2,400; 30%-40% = 3,600  +20 % point 1,9200,000 480,000 +10 % point 960,000 1,440,000 480,000 +10 % point 960,000 1,440,000  Expansion and innovation  15  Grant will be released in 3 installments: 1st installment (20%) will be released after the cell is duly established and its regulatory framework/guidelines in place; 2nd installment (40%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report of 1 st round student counseling; 3rd installment (40%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report of 2nd round student counseling. 16 Grant will be released in 3 installments; 1st installment (20%) will be released after the cell is duly established and its regulatory framework/guidelines in place; 2nd installment (30%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report of 1 st round institute-industry dialogue; 3rd installment (40%) will be released upon receipt of a satisfactory progress report during the last 1 to 2 years..  27  No  Performance Indicator  8  New Program in TSLC17 New program in Diploma18 New innovative program in TSLC19 New innovative program in Diploma20  9 10  11  Unit  Per unit per Capita Grant, NRP  Quantity  Grant Amount, NPR 6,00,000 1,200,000  Remarks  Not per capita; not applicable for private institutions  800,000  1,600,000  Table 2: District Human Development Indices Districts  HDI  HDIF (Actual)  HDIF (Standar dized)  No.  Districts  HDI  HDIF (Actual)  HDIF (Standar dized)  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Sankhuwasabh a Solukhumbu Taplejung Bhojpur Dhankuta Ilam Khotang Okhaldhunga Panchthar Terhathum  0.481 0.479 0.467 0.472 0.507 0.521 0.442 0.481 0.484 0.523  0.979 0.983 1.009 0.998 0.929 0.904 1.066 0.979 0.973 0.901  1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.0  39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  0.492 0.454 0.467 0.593 0.492 0.498 0.486 0.504 0.535 0.524  0.9573 1.0374 1.0086 0.7943 0.9573 0.9458 0.9691 0.9345 0.8804 0.8989  1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0  11  Udaypur  0.488  0.965  1.0  49  0.437  1.0778  1.1  12  Jhapa  0.494  0.953  1.0  50  0.482  0.9772  1.0  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  Morang Saptari Siraha Sunsari Dolakha Rasuwa Sindhupalchok Dhading KavrePalancho wk Makwanpur  0.531 0.453 0.427 0.5 0.45 0.394 0.414 0.41  0.887 1.040 1.103 0.942 1.047 1.195 1.138 1.149  1.0 1.0 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.2 1.1 1.1  51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58  Baglung Gorkha Gulmi Kaski Lamjung Myagdi Palpa Parbat Syangja Tanahun Kapilbast u Nawalpar asi Rupandeh i Dolpa Humla Jumla Kalikot Mugu Dailekh Jajarkot  0.546 0.371 0.367 0.348 0.322 0.304 0.381 0.343  0.8626 1.2695 1.2834 1.3534 1.4627 1.5493 1.2362 1.3732  1.0 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.2 1.4  0.543 0.479  0.867 0.983  1.0 1.0  59 60  Pyuthan Rolpa  0.416 0.384  1.1322 1.2266  1.1 1.2  No .  21 22 17  Grants will be released in 3 installments: 1st installment (20%) after enrollment of 1st batch students; 2nd installment (30%) once the batch appears in the first exam; 3rd installment once the batch appears in the final exams. 18 .

Scholarship Recipients The interaction focused on notification of scholarship opportunity, selection process, notification of scholarship recipients, registration and verification process of scholarship recipients, opening of bank account of each recipient, dispatch money in each students account, conditions for scholarship, use of scholarship, and students’ feelings and reactions on scholarship. Key Findings        Students received information about the availability of scholarships mostly through their schools and also from newspapers and friends and relatives. After notification students opened bank account in Rastriya Banijya Bank, signed the Scholarship Bond Paper (most of them signed the bond without reading the conditions that applied to their maintaining their eligibility status). The school authorities were handling the check books in one training center and the PS has been asked to correct this immediately. Most students chose to undertake the TSLC/Diploma because of the scholarship; otherwise they would have chosen other subjects of study. A few would have not undertaken any further studies. Most students said they would look for work after completing their course of study. For effective communication and outreach, the students suggested that use of the local FM Radio (morning, news time, evening), Kantipur (national daily), and notice through schools would be effective.  B. Training of Trainers (Master Trainers, Lead Trainers, Assistant Trainers) In the meeting the discussion focused on how trainees got the notice of training, their motivation to apply, overall management of training and classroom instruction, the quality and adequacy of trainers, training curriculum, trainees’ assessment and instructional materials. In addition, trainees were asked about their own assessment of differences in their knowledge, skill and attitude before and after the training. Key Findings       Master Trainers learnt about the availability of this training through newspaper and website of EVENT, CTEVT and MOE while lead trainers and assistant trainers got information mostly from friends and newspapers. TOT trainees were selected through very competitive entrance tests. They were motivated because TOT has a good market in various fields including technical education and vocational training, and TITI has a very good reputation. The curriculum was relevant and adequate; instructional materials and presentation techniques were friendly, and delivery in the classroom was impressive. In every lesson there were two trainers in the classroom. There were qualified experts, resource persons, and technical assistants that made instruction, interesting and enjoyable. The specific learning from these trainings were instructional material preparation, use of instructional materials, presentation skills, micro-teaching for self assessment, motivation techniques, one on one coaching, correcting trainees’ home work, competency based individualized learning, questioning techniques, writing skills, active listening, time management, and so on. 30      Trainees found a big difference before and after the training among themselves. The differences were found in their knowledge of TOT and rigorous time management skills. Trainers’ attendance, discipline with regard to trainees’ attendance, reward for good performance and continuous assessment were also appreciated. Recommendations made by trainees included: (a) learning content was interesting but time was too short, (b) equalize per diem amounts for Master Trainers, Lead Trainers and Assistant Trainers.  C. Training of Assessors (Skill Test Assessors and Skill Test Managers) In the meeting the discussion focused on how trainees got the notice of training, their motivation to apply, overall management of training and classroom instruction, the quality and adequacy of trainers, training curriculum, trainees’ assessment and instructional materials. In addition, trainees were asked about their own assessment of differences in their knowledge, skill and attitude before and after the training. Key Findings          Trainees got information from people they knew, newspapers, websites and local FM radios. Technical professionals were motivated to join to enhance their professional skills, sharpen their technical expertise, and to be able to take up the opportunity go to different parts of the country. Some said that being involved in skill test activities would also give them the opportunity for marketing their business as well. Some trainees applied through e-mail that made them easy and got reply of their selection by email. Previously, some of the trainees had been employed as assessors based on their professional experience. After this training, the trainees said they were able to conduct skill test in a more organized and systematic way. They now also knew what technical competency was; and how competency levels were used in a real job at the workplace. In every lesson there were two trainers in the classroom. There were qualified experts, resource persons, and technical assistants that made instruction easy. Every minute was interesting and enjoyable. Time keeping was very strict for both trainers and trainees. Three days time was enough for training. Training allowances, lunch and training management was good.  31  ANNEX 6  Area of work  Issues  Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) (Updated in July 2012) Risks Actions to address the risks Responsi Timeline Early ble warning agency signs  Status of implementati on  Organizational arrangements Coordinatio n in project implementa tion  Weak collaboration  between GoN agencies, sometimes, to overlapping responsibilities  The Coordination Committee will meet bi- MOE annually to achieve better communication and coordination among all project entities.    Interdepartmental cooperation between participating GoN agencies  The Project Implementation MOE Committee representing all project entities will ensure effective communications on a regular basis.

Results Framework Analysis Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document) The overall objectives of the Project are to minimize the threat in Nepal posed to humans by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonotic diseases by controlling such infections among domestic poultry and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza epidemic and other related infectious disease emergencies in humans. These objectives were to be achieved in three types of interventions: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. If these goals were achieved, the Project would reduce the burden of disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity attributable to human infections in Nepal and limit the spread to other countries as well.

Project Context, Development Objectives and Design 1.1 Context at Appraisal 1.1.1 Nepal is a landlocked Himalayan country of 24 million people, bordering India and China. In 2006, Nepal was at high risk of avian influenza (AI) outbreaks in poultry, because of reported AI outbreaks in wild birds in China and poultry in India.5 The border controls with these countries were limited on the flow of both animals and humans. In addition, Nepal is on two routes for migratory birds. Out of all 75 districts in Nepal, 26 districts bordering India were at high-risk, and another 18 districts were at medium-risk. The ability to detect AI in the country was severely handicapped due to lack of physical access, related to Nepal’s rugged terrain and widespread security problems. 1.1.2 Poultry is an important sub-sector of agriculture in Nepal. In 2006, there were an estimated 22 million poultry and 408,000 ducks in Nepal. The poultry industry employed approximately 400,000 people, and provided livelihoods to millions of rural households. Approximately 45 percent of these poultry were hybrid and found in a few large commercial farms located in peri-urban areas. On the other hand, about 55 percent were indigenous fowls and kept in backyard units by around 50 percent of rural households across Nepal. Most of the commercial farms had some bio-security arrangements in place, but the rest of the supply chain was unorganized. Birds were transported in traditional baskets and butchered in the open air with no standard safe disposal mechanism for waste material. 1.1.3 Animal health. The Department of Livestock Services (DLS), under the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), had a well-knit veterinary service delivery infrastructure, supported by a central veterinary hospital, 75 district livestock service offices, and 999 livestock service centers at the village level. DLS had and still has 132 livestock officers, 178 veterinary officers, 1,000 para-vets, and 6,000 village animal health workers.6 There were eight veterinary laboratories in Nepal, three at the central and five at the regional levels7. DLS also had nine Animal Quarantine Offices8 supported by 24 Animal Quarantine Check Posts at borders. 1.1.4 Human health. A public health service delivery system was reasonably well established in Nepal with the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) at the center, five regional health directorates, regional and zonal hospitals, and district level hospitals. All 75 districts had public health offices and district hospitals with an outreach network of 188 primary health care centers,  5  Source: World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The first outbreak in China was reported in 2005. In 2006, India reported first outbreaks in mid-west (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat). 6 In addition, there were approximately 500 private veterinarians and 10,000 private para-vets. They were either attached to the private commercial entities, such as commercial poultry firms or farm stores. 7 The three laboratories are: Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), National Avian Disease Investigation Laboratory (NADIL), and Foot and Mouth Disease/Trans-boundary Animal Diseases (FMD/TADs) Laboratory. The Five Regional Veterinary Laboratories are located in every region: eastern (Biratnagar), central (Janakpur), western (Pokhara), mid-western (Surkhet) and far-western (Dhangadhi). 8 One is at the central level, and the remaining eight are at the regional level (each quarantine office is responsible for two to three border districts.  1  698 village health posts and 3,219 sub-health posts. However, the health system was constrained by quality of care and access, which was being addressed by the Nepal Health Sector Program (NHSP I, a SWAp supported by IDA, DFID and other partners). 1.1.5 Coordination. The Government of Nepal (GON) set up an inter-sectoral task force under the chairmanship of the Director-General of Health Services. In early-2006, MOAC and MOHP jointly prepared a National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (NAIIPPRP), with assistance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This Plan was formally endorsed by the GON and was later supplemented by an operational plan. The coordination function was shifted to the Technical Sub-committee on Avian Influenza (TSCAI) under the Central National Disaster Relief Committee. TSCAI was jointly chaired by the Secretaries of MOAC and MOHP. 1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators 1.2.1 The overall objectives of the Project were to minimize the threat in Nepal posed to humans by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonotic diseases by controlling such infections among domestic poultry and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza epidemic and other related infectious disease emergencies in humans. These objectives were to be achieved in three types of interventions: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. As a result, AICP was to reduce the burden of disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to human infections in Nepal. It was also to limit the spread of the disease to other countries. The PDO indicators were as follows: (a) Positive behavior change related to avian influenza among three groups:  (i) poultry  farmers, (ii) health workers, and (iii) general population (b) Continued absence of HPAI in poultry and effective containment of HPAI infection in  poultry in case of outbreaks 1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification 1.3.1 The PDO and key indicators remained unchanged. However, 15 of the 18 intermediate outcome indicators were revised, clarified, or dropped at restructuring approved on March 5, 2010. Substantial changes were made to the following two intermediate results indicators (the details are provided in Annex 2).  Indicator 3  Indicator 4  Original 24 fully functional check posts where AI is accurately monitored and 8 patrolling teams active across international borders, as verified by site visits 90 percent of bio-security level 3 (BSL3)Office laboratory results fully consistent with International des epizooties (OIE, also known as World Organization for Animal Health) reference laboratory results  Revised/clarified Percent of active focused surveillance teams effectively operating in 12 high-risk districts  Percent of rapid test results fully consistent with industry standards for HPAI testing using rapid test kits  2  1.4 Main Beneficiaries 1.4.1 The project was intended to benefit 24 million people in Nepal, by reducing (i) the burden of disease in poultry and the consequent economic losses; and (ii) the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity attributable to human infections through increased awareness of AI prevention. Specifically, the project was intended to benefit the following target groups: (a) Poultry farmers (both commercial and backyard), who would benefit from increased awareness about preventive measures against AI, improved bio-security, and compensation, in case of outbreaks; (b) Veterinary networks, laboratories, disease surveillance systems, and hospitals that would benefit from improved facilities, equipments, reagents, antiviral drugs, and training; (c) The participating ministries (MOAC and MOHP) which would benefit from training and capacity building as well as provision of transportation and equipment thereby making them better prepared to deal with outbreaks of AI and other zoonoses and infectious diseases; and (d) Consumers and other stakeholders who would benefit from being better informed and aware of the risks to human health. 1.5 Original Components 1.5.1 The project consisted of four components: (a) animal health, (b) human health, (c) communication, and (d) project management. The original total project cost was US$18.2 million, including physical and price contingencies of US$2.37 million9. The base project cost was US$15.83 million. 1.5.2 Component A. Animal Health (US$6.12 million, 38.7 percent of the base project cost) to support national prevention and control strategies by the following five subcomponents. This component was implemented by DLS, with technical support from FAO:  Sub-component A.1: Surveillance to develop and strengthen: (a) surveillance and epidemiological investigation; (b) participatory disease intelligence; (c) capacity building of veterinary and wildlife professionals and poultry entrepreneurs; and (d) Geographic Information System (GIS)-based animal disease surveillance and information system.  Sub-component A.2: Prevention and containment to strengthen animal quarantine infrastructure, including provision of transportation.  Sub-component A.3: Laboratory capacity to upgrade FMD)/TAD laboratory to BSL3 and other seven veterinary laboratories (two central and five regional) to bio-security level 2 (BSL2).  Sub-component A.4: Field Veterinary Services to establish rapid response teams (RRTs) in all 75 districts for containment and sero-surveillance and to provide equipment.  Sub-component A.5: Compensation fund to set up rates and mechanism for affected backyard as well as commercial farmers.  9  Physical contingencies were 5 percent of the total base project costs of US$15.83 million, which was US$0.79 million. Likewise, price contingencies were 10 percent of the total base costs and were US$1.58 million.  3  1.5.3 Component B. Human Health (US$6.34 million, 40 percent of the base project cost) to prevent a human influenza epidemic caused by HPAI and other communicable diseases by the following three subcomponents. The component was implemented by DOHS, under MOHP, with support from WHO.  Sub-component B.1: Surveillance and Laboratory Strengthening by (a) training district and regional RRTs in surveillance and diagnosis; (b) improving influenza-likeillness (ILI) reporting through the Early Warning and reporting System (EWARS) network; (c) enhancing human AI and viral pneumonia surveillance through the WHO/Immunization Preventable Diseases (IPD) system; (d) upgrading the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) to BSL3; and (e) establishing the Laboratory Information Management System.  Sub-component B.2: Prevention and containment to support: (a) prevention of avian and seasonal influenza in high-risk occupational settings, (b) prevention of transmission in high-risk contacts of persons diagnosed with AI, (c) planning for acquisition and use of pandemic influenza vaccine, (d) development of a quarantine network for Nepal (later substituted by the establishment of travel advisory during pandemic), (e) legal and regulatory review, and (f) planning for non-pharmacologic interventions to contain human avian and pandemic influenza.  Sub-component B.3: Health care delivery system preparedness and response. This sub-component was to (a) develop an acute respiratory disease (ARD) triage and referral system, (b) support planning for the primary care system in meeting health care needs during an influenza pandemic; and (c) establishment of negative pressure isolation wards at referral hospitals and validation with O&M manuals. 1.5.4 Component C. Communication (US$1.65 million, 10.4 percent of the base project cost) to reduce the negative social impact and threat to human health posed by AI outbreaks in poultry through advocacy, behavioral change communication, and social mobilization. This component was implemented jointly by DLS and the National Health Education Information Communication Center (NHEICC), under MOHP. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) provided technical support and implemented the Community Based School Education Program (CB-SEP) in eight districts. 10 1.5.5 Component D. Project management (US$1.72 million, 10.9 percent of the base project cost) to support project management, including financial management (FM), procurement, safeguards and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), as well as operational costs for both DLS and DOHS. 1.6 Revised Components 1.6.1 The four components remained unchanged throughout the project implementation, with one exception. There were changes in the laboratory capacity sub-components in both animal and human health, because of the cancellation of construction of two BSL3 laboratories. Instead  10  The funds are allocated through DLS (animal health related activities) and DOHS (human health related activities). DLS was accountable for the UNICEF allocation. The AICP financed CB-SEP in five districts.  4  of upgrading two laboratories to BSL3 (one veterinary and one public health) and seven veterinary laboratories to BSL2, the project upgraded all nine laboratories to BSL2. 1.7 Other significant changes 1.7.1 The project was restructured twice: partial cancellation of US$2.28 million in March 2010 and reallocation between categories in January 2011. The partial cancellation was related mostly to cancellation of budgetary allocation for two BSL3 laboratories. AICP, instead, upgraded these two laboratories to BSL2. It also changed the veterinary surveillance to focus on commercial farms in 12 selected high-risk districts (out of all 26 high-risk districts) from border patrol. Quarantine and bio-security were to be improved by trans-border workshops and training. As a result of these changes, the total project cost was reduced to US$17 million, and 15 of 18 intermediate outcome indicators were revised or clarified (details are provided in Annex 2). 1.7.2 The reallocation between categories dealt with the unallocated US$ 684,75211 that was made available for the animal health component. This filled a financing gap in the animal health component that was created by an outbreak response in October 2010 and the Bank positively responded to request from the GON. 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes 2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry 2.1.1 The project design contained both emergency response and longer-term institutional capacity building to prevent and control HPAI and other zoonotic diseases. It adopted the Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI)12 and incorporated lessons learned from the on-going HPAI projects in Asia and other Bank-supported projects in Nepal. These lessons included establishment of a compensation fund at flat rate to enable rapid reimbursement and strengthening weak procurement and M&E capacities at DLS and DOHS by hiring consultants. Due to outbreaks in neighboring India and China in 2006, the original AICP emphasized poultry surveillance at border crossing and quarantine. 2.1.2 In strengthening diagnostic capacities, the pros and cons of constructing two BSL3 laboratories in veterinary and public health were discussed extensively with GON stakeholders and UN counterparts (FAO and WHO). The Bank team flagged its concerns at pre-appraisal about the substantial investment and operating cost requirements of BSL3, particularly staffing demands. Although HPAI diagnosis would be possible by BSL2, other stakeholders argued that the construction of two BSL3 laboratories was justified to strengthen system capacity beyond HPAI and to enable rapid in-country confirmation. The Government was concerned that  11  Because of XDR appreciation in conversion at partial cancellation, the balance was placed as unallocated. GPAI was endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Directors in January 2006, as a horizontal adaptable program loan (APL) with a global envelope of $500 million. GPAI was developed in 2005, at the height of the H5N1 spread in humans in several Asian countries. As AI virus constantly evolves with unpredictable results, the risk of a human pandemic was considered highly likely. Because of the multi-sectoral nature, involving health, agriculture, economics, finance, planning, and others, the Bank was considered the best suited institution to effectively coordinate UN and other specialized agencies, including FAO, WHO, and UNICEF. 12  5  depending on an external reference laboratory would delay confirmation of AI, which in turn could delay AI containment by three weeks.13 2.2 Implementation 2.2.1 The implementation progress was rated moderately satisfactory. Although the project was a time sensitive emergency operation, the implementation had a slow start, largely due to delayed procurement of UN partners and staffing of key positions at both DLS and DOHS on a full-time basis. FAO and WHO were to provide turnkey technical support to DLS and DOHS, respectively, in designing BSL3, developing surveillance programs, providing technical training, and procuring personal protective equipment (PPE) and anti-virals. Likewise, UNICEF was to support DLS and NHEICC in developing a communication program and messages and to implement a Community Based School Education Program (CB-SEP). About one year after project effectiveness, the three UN agencies (FAO, WHO and UNICEF) were contracted under blanket agreements, 14 and the implementation started picking up around mid-2008. The communication program was launched in March 2008, and DLS and DOHS developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in containment and compensation, surveillance, laboratory protocol, case management, and communication. The SOPs were translated into Nepali and tested during the first HPAI outbreaks in Jhapa district in early-200915 and the H1N1 pandemic in end-2009 16 . In Jhapa, 164 birds died with infection, and 27,724 birds were culled. 164 commercial farmers and around 1,200 backyard farmers were affected. There was a delay in providing compensation, because the rates were not accepted by these farmers (detailed in Annex 2). Despite the successful containment and case management, both DLS and DOHS had difficulty in building institutional capacities in prevention and preparedness, such as strengthening surveillance and diagnostics. By the Mid-term Review (MTR) in July 2009, only 34 percent of the grant was disbursed. 2.2.2 There was a substantial delay in designing the veterinary and public health BSL3 laboratories, due to later-than-expected contracting of FAO and WHO and global high demand for limited technical expertise for this purpose. At MTR in July 2009, the Bank and the Government had extensive discussions and agreed on cancelling the funds allocated for the construction of the BSL3 laboratories, because (a) there was about 84 percent increase in needed investments compared to the estimate at appraisal, which could not be financed within the project envelope;17 (b) recurrent costs were estimated at approximately US$300,000 per year for the two laboratories, that would not break-even at expected future operating levels;18 and (c) civil  13  Second pre-appraisal mission Aide Memoire (July 3-13, 2006) There was no prior agreement on the scope of the United Nations (UN) involvement and financial terms. The blanket agreements amounted to US$2.39 million with FAO, US$2.20 million with WHO, and US$ 360,000 with UNICEF. 15 Two outbreaks were contained in January and February 2009 in Jhapa district in the southeast, bordering West Bengal, India. 16 There were 174 cases in Nepal, plus 3 deaths. See http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section2562_15047.htm (accessed in December 2011) 17 The construction cost for two BSL3 laboratories was estimated at US$1.85 million at appraisal. However, the revised cost was US$3.4 million at MTR. 18 This consists of normal recurrent cost of US$200,000 and auxiliary generator operation of US$96,000. The reference laboratory in the United Kingdom (UK) charges approximately US$15 per sample, and its continued use 14  6  work would not be completed by the time the project closed. While the confirmation of positives by a local BSL3 would be faster, the saving in time would make little difference to containment practices, as the adopted SOPs call for a positive diagnosis based on the rapid test to trigger an immediate outbreak response in the field. By mid-2009, AICP improved the diagnostic capacity at CVL, which became 90 percent consistent with the OIE reference laboratory. 2.2.3 Instead of building two BSL3 laboratories, the project focused on upgrading nine laboratories (eight veterinary and one public health) to BSL2. With support from FAO, AICP also revised poultry surveillance at MTR to focus on commercial farms in 12 selected high-risk districts (out of all 26 high-risk districts), in particular, cross-border trade routes, rather than surveillance at the border crossing. In complementing DLS capacities in quarantine and communication, trans-border quarantine workshops were also included. These changes were translated into a new implementation plan, with a net cost savings of US$ 2.28 million (about 13 percent of the original project cost). While the agreement in restructuring was reached at the right time (at MTR in July 2009), it took almost eight months for the restructuring package to be approved (on March 5, 2010). This was, however, less than the 12- month average for Nepal. 2.2.4 The restructuring included a partial cancellation of the above savings. In early-2010, there were eight HPAI outbreaks19, and AICP culled 29,347 birds20 and destroyed 4,512 eggs, 114 kg of bird feed, and 149 kg of poultry meat. The compensation amounted to NRS 2,912,260 (approximately, US$ 41,000) and was paid on time to both backyard and commercial farmers. By mid-2010, disbursement improved from 38 to 62 percent. In June 2010, GON made a request for an additional US$ 1.6million to enhance veterinary response capacity,21 to be financed by AHIF. The Bank team indicated its willingness to support the AHIF application, provided that project implementation accelerated and IDA disbursement improved to 75 percent by September 2010.22 This, however, was not achieved, thus, no additional financing was sought. 2.2.5 In 2011, the disbursement was steady but lagging, because of delayed consolidation of regional and district level expenditures at both DLS and DOHS (detailed in paragraph 2.4.2). By project closure, AICP completed implementation of the planned activities, including upgrading the nine laboratories to BSL2. However, the BSL2 at NPHL (designated as the National Influenza Center), and the isolation wards at Shukraraj Tropical Infectious Diseases Hospital (designated as the National Referral Hospital), were not yet fully operational. The O&M training  would be more cost effective. According to the cost benefit analysis, BSL3 would need to process an average of 8,000 samples per year to break even, representing 100 times the number of samples tested during the outbreaks recorded todate in 2009 for the next 25 years. This implies a 20-fold increase of the likely figure of five outbreaks per year, while the current figure of 80 samples per year as recorded in the outbreaks of 2009 would translate into a prohibitive average of US$3,700 per sample. 19 Seven HPAI outbreaks occurred in Kaski, Chitwan, Rupandehi, Dang, Banke, and Kailali districts between January and March 2010. There was one outbreak in Chitwan in October 2010. Except for Kaski in Central Nepal, these districts bordering India. 20 This includes 28,115 poultry, 886 ducks and 346 pigeons. These were mostly backyard, but there were a few commercial Muscovy ducks in Kaski and 11,437 commercial layers in Chitwan. 21 The proposal was to finance warehouse construction, quarantine office renovation, laboratory upgrading, additional transportation, and SMS gateway. 22 The team estimated that this would have given sufficient time to satisfactorily implement the planned activities under the Trust Fund (TF) by the IDA project closure date.  7  was not undertaken, because relevant technical staff was not yet appointed by MOHP. Surveillance activities carried out under the project actually exceeded original plans, as the surveillance was carried out in all 26 high risk districts, rather than the planned 12 districts. 2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization 2.3.1 The project M&E is rated modest. The M&E framework was designed by adopting the GPAI results framework. However, the project framework could have been better structured to capture all aspects of PDOs by upgrading a few intermediate results indicators related to prevention and institutional preparedness. 2.3.2 Although there were some improvements during implementation, both DLS and DOHS were weak in data collection and reporting. Initially, only a few outputs were reported to the Bank, such as number of samples collected in poultry surveillance. Neither DLS nor DOHS was able to report on PDO or intermediate outcome indicators until after MTR. The March 5, 2010 restructuring revised or clarified most intermediate outcome indicators, and made those more relevant in measuring focused surveillance in high-risk districts and diagnostic capacity development. This helped both DLS and DOHS report project outputs and progress towards the results framework to the Bank. The communication activities were well-monitored by UNICEF by three Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) surveys. 23 While general awareness was captured by these surveys, the project did not obtain AI awareness data among poultry farmers and health workers (PDO indicator) separately. It would have been useful to have an M&E consultant to ensure that the data collection was segregated by target group and/or gender, reporting on the results framework, and utilizing all M&E data for planning and reporting. It would have also helped to properly document good practices in more quantitative and qualitative terms, for example, on in-kind compensation and Civil Society Organization (CSO) mobilization in stamping-out operations. 2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance 2.4.1 Safeguards. AICP was assessed as a Category B project in environmental safeguards. DLS prepared the Environment Management Plan (EMP), including waste management (safe disposal of carcasses) in July 2006. Additional protocols were also developed on safe handling of chemicals and development and management of burial pits. DOHS applied the health care waste management plan developed in June 2006 for the Nepal Health Sector Program (SWAp supported by IDA and other partners). 2.4.2 Outbreak containment was managed by the District Avian Influenza Technical Committee (DAITEC), composed of a Chief District Officer, municipalities, District Development Committee (DDC), District DLS, and District DOHS. DAITEC was to identify the disposal pit location and maintain its safety, including groundwater quality. During the outbreak in Pokhara (Kaski district) in early-2010, DAITEC promised a community nearby the disposal pit to rehabilitate their main access road. This was not completed by the project closure, and DLS  23  Baseline was financed by the Government of Japan, and AICP financed two other surveys. UNICEF also undertook mini-KAP surveys annually.  8  is following up with DAITEC. A groundwater quality test was not undertaken during project implementation. However, DLS is also committed to undertake this task as a part of GON’s annual program. 2.4.3 Financial management (FM). FM was rated moderately unsatisfactory. The capacity was strengthened over time at both DLS and DOHS, but it remained weak due to limited staff capacity and frequent staff turnover, which was affected by the overall weak country FM environment. Although the March 5, 2010 restructuring improved implementation and disbursement, a mismatch between expenditure and disbursement developed, because of delays in reconciliation at the central level. This was a challenge, particularly for DLS, which had 84 cost centers at the central, district, and municipal levels24 (DOHS had only seven centers in 5 regions and Kathmandu). FM information systems were developed at both DLS and DOHS, but the system was not operational at DOHS. The submission of trimester FM reports and audit reports were delayed most of the time due to weak capacity as well as slow reconciliation of the accounts with various cost centers. In 2009, disbursement had to be suspended for both Departments due to delayed submission of audited accounts. 2.4.4 Procurement. Procurement was rated moderately unsatisfactory. Capacity was built at both DLS and DOHS over time, although limited. Despite weak capacities at both Departments, the procurement plan was frontloaded, in enhancing emergency response. USAID and FAO provided procurement support to DOHS and DLS, respectively, and staff was trained at the Nepal Administrative Staff College. However, both DLS and DOHS received complaints from bidders, one of which dealt with the veterinary BSL2 equipment package (worth US$ 850,000), which had to be investigated by the Bank’s Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) as well as the GON Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. The case was cleared, but a new tender had to be issued with less detailed specifications (such as brand names). This delayed commissioning of veterinary BSL2 at the central and regional levels. 2.5 Post-completion Operation 2.5.1 Given the history of HPAI outbreaks in Nepal, it is critical to continue effective surveillance for prevention and control. GON is committed to sustain the key prevention and control activities and has made the following budgetary allocation for the FY 2011/12: NRS60 million (approximately US$800,000) for DLS, NRS13 million (approximately US$160,000) for DOHS, and NRS400,000 (about US$5,000) for NHEICC (under MOHP). To ensure rapid containment of HPAI outbreaks and disease surveillance in high-risk districts, DLS is maintaining the AICP structure to construct a warehouse with their own resources. DLS, with the AICP structure, rapidly responded to HPAI outbreak in Bhaktapur in November 2011, several months after project closing. The human health investments in surveillance and diagnostics would be sustained by DOHS epidemiology and disease control division and NIC with support from WHO and the Government’s Second HNP and HIV/AIDS Program. In addition, the AHIFfinanced South Asia Regional Training Program in Epidemiology and Bio-security would also  24  49 centers were under MOAC (in Kathmandu and districts), while 35 were at District Development Committees under the Ministry of Local Development (MOLD).  9  strengthen in-country as well as regional epidemiology capacities in veterinary and public health.25 2.5.2 Building on AICP investments, additional support26 to further strengthen DLS and DOHS capacities to prevent and control infectious diseases that transmit between animals and humans (zoonoses) is proposed. This would be financed by AHIF and would complement the on-going Poverty Alleviation Fund activities at community level, as well as two projects under preparation: the Agriculture and Food Security Project (to be financed by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program - GAFSP)27 and the Resilience to Climate Related Hazards Project (to be financed by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, PPCR). In addition to enhancing surveillance, diagnostics, climate sensitive disease risk mitigation, and communication, the proposed AHIF support would strengthen bio-security and food safety throughout the poultry or meat product value chains by piloting establishment of model live bird/meat markets. The pilot would be a replication of good practice in the Bank’s HPAI projects in Vietnam and Nigeria.28 3. Assessment of Outcomes 3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation 3.1.1 AICP’s relevance to objectives, design, and implementation were high. The objectives remained relevant to the Nepal Interim Strategy Note (ISN) (FY08-FY0929 and FY10-FY11). AICP supported pillar III “promoting access to better quality services” by improving public health service delivery in preventing and managing HPAI and other communicable diseases. While Nepal did not have any HPAI case in humans, the institutional mechanism was tested during the H1N1 outbreaks in 2009. The project also strengthened veterinary service delivery in prevention and response to HPAI outbreaks in the poultry sector, which supports rural livelihoods and nutrition for vulnerable groups (see Section 3.5). 3.1.2 The project design remained relevant in addressing both emergency and longer-term institutional capacity building to prepare for, prevent, and control HPAI outbreaks. The design adopted the GPAI framework, but the key activities such as surveillance and diagnostics were adjusted at the March 5, 2010 restructuring on the basis of HPAI status in Nepal and cost benefit analysis of constructing and operating two BSL3 laboratories (see Section 2.2). Also, the project implementation was consistent with Nepal’s development priorities. The project successfully contained 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry and strengthened DLS and DOHS capacities in  25  The Regional Training Program in Epidemiology and Bio-security trained 70 veterinarians and medical doctors from seven countries in South Asia to obtain master’s degree in epidemiology. Five students are participating from Nepal (two veterinarians and three medical doctors). The program will also set up centers of excellence in epidemiology by strengthening existing epidemiology institutions and developing national and regional networks. The total cost of the program is US$7.7 million. 26 The proposed follow-on project would seek approximately US$10 million from AHIF to support (a) surveillance and diagnostics, (b) bio-security and quarantine, (c) model live bird/meat market, (d) climate sensitive disease risk mitigation, (e) communication, and (f) institutional strengthening. 27 GAFSP approved the allocation of US$46.5 million for Nepal. PPCR approved US$86 million for Nepal, of which $25-30 million would be dedicated to strengthening warning systems for climate related hazards. 28 See Nigeria AICP Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) (Report No: ICR00001804) 29 The previous CAS for Nepal was discussed in November 2003.  10  surveillance, diagnostics, bio-safety, quarantine, response (containment or case management) and communication. 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives 3.2.1 The project achieved its PDO. AICP minimized the threat posed by H5N1 to humans and the poultry industry by (a) successfully containing 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry birds with no transmission to humans and strengthening veterinary and public health diagnostic capacities with high consistencies with reference laboratories (90-100 percent); (b) preventing HPAI or other zoonotic disease outbreaks in birds or humans by enhanced surveillance network (95 percent commercial farms surveyed in all 26 high-risk districts, and 86 percent EWARS coverage nationwide); (c) improving preparedness by reviewing relevant legal frameworks, developing and testing 11 SOPs; and (d) increasing HPAI awareness by 21 percent points (from 61 to 82 percent). Two PDO indicators were achieved, although the level of awareness was not made available by target group. All technical intermediate results indicators were achieved, with shortfalls recorded in the two project management indicators (details are in ICR datasheet). The key project achievements are summarized below (and detailed in Annex 2). 3.2.2 Response and containment. AICP successfully contained 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry, ducks, and pigeons, with no transmission to humans. Compensation was established at an acceptable rate for poultry (detailed in Annex 2) and paid to affected farmers on time (except for those affected by the first HPAI outbreak in 2009). The package also included in-kind hybrid chicks for backyard farmers and optional credit for re-stocking for commercial farmers. As a result, affected backyard farmers doubled their income following the HPAI outbreak from sales of eggs and meat of the hybrid poultry.30 Despite the 10 outbreaks, there was an increase in the number of poultry birds in Nepal by about 11 percent (24.5 million). The population of ducks, however, declined by about 7 percent (380,000).31 The rapid response capacity was enhanced due to improved diagnostic capacity: rapid test results at CVL were 90 percent consistent with those at OIE reference laboratory, and quality control tests at NPHL were 100 percent consistent with WHO’s reference laboratory. While construction of two BSL3 laboratories was cancelled, nine laboratories, including CVL and NPHL, were upgraded to BSL2. NPHL, however, was not fully operational, due to inadequate staffing. With support from WHO, AICP provided 2,500 personal protective equipment32 and 6,300 courses of anti-virals, which fully covered the needs for targeted animal and human health workers in all 26 high-risk districts. During the H1N1 pandemic, DOHS set up 12 travel advisory health desks for international and domestic travelers and reduced the H1N1 transmission by identifying 39 suspected cases33. 3.2.3 Prevention. The active and focused poultry surveillance was operational in all 26 highrisk districts, monitoring 95 percent commercial and 25 percent backyard farmers. During implementation, AICP doubled district coverage to monitor all 26 high-risk districts (as compared to 12 originally planned districts) and exceeded the backyard surveillance target by 10  30  This was confirmed by a field visit by the Bank team in June 2011 during the final supervision/ICR mission. Compared to the appraisal in 2006. Pathak, P., “Control and Containment of HPAI in Nepal (Lessons Learned)”, presentation at the Stakeholder Workshop in June 2011 32 In addition, 2,250 PPEs were provided in-kind by USAID. 33 Out of a total of 337,563 travelers screened during the period 31  11  percent points. Eight pick-ups and 22 motorcycles were provided to enhance surveillance capacity in high-risk districts. The GIS-based, Global Positioning System (GPS) centric animal disease information system (e.g., TADinfo) was also established, linking nine institutions, including DLS and five regional veterinary laboratories. Eighty eight (88) percent of the EWARS surveillance sites regularly submitted reports to DOHS, which exceeded the 80 percent target. 3.2.4 Preparedness and planning. AICP developed 11 SOPs (five by DLS and six by DOHS), including surveillance, quarantine, response (containment, home/community based-care, clinical case management, and infection control), laboratory, environment management, and risk communication. DLS also reviewed three legal frameworks, including Bird Flu Control Order, to enable containment activities, and DOHS prepared the Communicable Disease Control Act. SOPs were tested and refined by responding to 10 HPAI outbreaks and H1N1 pandemic. DLS undertook eight simulation exercises in collaboration with USAID and FAO. In enhancing district planning, DOHS distributed non-pharmaceutical intervention plans to all 75 districts, 18 of which (24 percent) prepared their own plan with USAID support.34 3.2.5 AI awareness. A comprehensive HPAI communication program was launched in 2008 and increased the HPAI awareness by 21 percent from baseline. The end-line KAP survey also indicates that there was a 60 percent points increase in knowledge on AI preventive measures among adult family members who are likely to handle their backyard poultry (detailed in Section 3.6). This was enabled by media and training outreach implemented in coordination among DLS, NHEICC, and UNICEF, in particular, UNICEF’s CB-SEP. In 8 selected high-risk districts (out of 26 high-risk districts), UNICEF trained 183,000 students and teachers on HPAI and its prevention practices and also built capacities of 64 CSOs in developing district level risk communication networks.35 The media awareness campaign covered at least 50 percent of the population in 26 high-risk districts.36 AICP also trained 750 media spokespersons on HPAI, and 1,703 security personnel, traders, and farmers on bio-security and quarantine. 3.3 Efficiency 3.3.1 The project’s efficiency was high. The economic analysis (detailed in Annex 3) related the project costs to the benefits derived from the economic value stream of losses, which were avoided from project activities in the poultry industry. This was expressed as the expected value of the economic loss avoided from outbreaks in a seven-year period (2008-2014). Project benefits are assumed to remain realizable over this period and beyond, attributable to the project expenditures on laboratories, equipment, awareness programs, and increase in human capital from the projects training activities. Under the “without project” scenario, it was assumed that after the 2009-2010 outbreaks - with about 17 percent of the poultry population being lost (as in  34  Humanitarian Pandemic Preparedness (H2P) financed by USAID AICP financed the implementation in five districts. UNICEF mobilized 64 CSOs of women, micro-credit, local ethnic groups, para-legal and/or youth (eight organizations per district) and formed DDCs. Eight hundred (800) committee members were trained on hand-washing, AI prevention, and risk communication. 36 Messages were aired on one national television and 26 local FM radio stations. The April 2006 Aide Memoire indicates that the access to radio is estimated at 50 percent for rural population and 62 percent for urban but access to television estimated at 1 percent for rural and 20 percent for urban. 35  12  the case of Vietnam during the 2003-2004 outbreaks) - the GON would have immediately implemented AICP to contain further outbreaks. Consequently, by 2014, after its completion the “with” and “without” situation would become the same in terms of preparedness, control, and results. The costs, benefits, and results of the economic analysis were based on the above assumptions and parameters for the avoided losses in the poultry sector. The results are very robust, with a 311 percent economic rate of return (ERR) and a net present value (NPV) of US$34.8 million. 3.3.2 A sensitivity analysis concerning the Gross Attack Rate (GAR) in the poultry sector in the “without project” situation during the 2009-2010 outbreaks was also undertaken. Even under highly conservative parameters (1 percent of GAR under the 2009-10 outbreaks) that severely underestimate the benefit estimations the economic returns to the AICP yielded 29 percent ERR and an NPV of US$2.8 million. It confirms that from an economic point of view the project was worth undertaking. 3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 3.4.1 Despite frequent implementation delays and disbursement lags, the project still achieved its PDOs. There was a strong commitment on part of the GON and willingness to resolve critical issues related to implementation. Overall outcomes are, thus, rated moderately satisfactory. 3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development 3.5.1 Although the project did not specifically focus on alleviating poverty, it generated positive social impacts by reducing the threat to human health, raising HPAI awareness and prevention practices, limiting poultry losses, and compensating for culled birds. Approximately 50 percent of rural households in Nepal have poultry in their backyard, and 30 percent of these households belong to Dalits and Janajati, which are the most disadvantaged social groups in Nepal.37 Moreover, backyard poultry is cared for primarily by women and children. Because nine of 10 outbreaks affected backyard farmers,38 the project’s prevention and control activities, such as surveillance, compensation, and communication, directly supported these vulnerable households in safeguarding their livelihoods and source of protein. Women were involved in verification of culled poultry during compensation. More than 18,805 farmers and animal health workers in 26 high-risk districts were trained on participatory disease surveillance at village level. UNICEF’s outreach to school children substantially contributed to increasing HPAI and general influenza awareness and prevention at the household level.  37 38  Fifty five (55) percent of poultry holders are Magar, while 15 percent of them are Brahman/Chhetri. The October 2010 outbreak in Chitwan affected commercial farms only.  13  (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening 3.5.2 AICP built institutional capacities at DLS and DOHS in preventing and controlling HPAI and other zoonotic disease outbreaks, such as H1N1. The project strengthened surveillance and disease detection, diagnosis, response (containment or case management), quarantine, biosecurity, and communication. DLS still maintains the AICP structure to continue key prevention activities, in particular, surveillance, and rapid response to HPAI outbreaks, which helped contain the recent outbreak in November 2011. DLS also mainstreamed communication into the Directorate of Extension Services and Training. 3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops 3.6.1 Beneficiary survey. The end-line KAP surveys were undertaken by UNICEF in five CBSEP districts. The highlights of these surveys are as follows but also detailed in Annex 5:  General HPAI awareness increased by 21 percent points to reach 82 percent (baseline was 61 percent). This exceeded the target of 80 percent.  Almost 40 percent points more now children wash hands after touching birds (94 percent of respondents, compared to 55 percent at baseline).  There was a 60 percent increase in knowledge on preventive measures in handling sick birds among adult family members.39 3.6.2 Stakeholder workshop. AICP organized a stakeholder workshop in June 2011. Key lessons learned were as follows but also detailed in Annex 6:  Communication is critical in preventing and controlling the spread of AI outbreaks. The project developed a communication package targeting the poultry farmers. In sustaining, DLS mainstreamed the communication activities under the Directorate of Extension and Training.  Rapid response was facilitated by cross-sectoral cooperation at the district level. During containment, AICP enabled a high level of cooperation among media, local governments, CSOs (such as local political parties and youth associations), and the public health sector. The partnership with media was important to ensure transparency in providing the correct information to the general public.  Compensation in cash and in-kind enhanced livelihoods of backyard farmers. The affected backyard farmers promptly received cash and later hybrid birds. However, the commercial farmers have not yet fully regained their stock. They took cash but not inkind compensation or optional credit.  The project had high-level support and ownership by MOAC. Throughout its implementation, the project had a high-level of ownership and support frm DLS as well as MOAC.  39  There was a 56 percent points increase in reporting sick birds to veterinary office (80 percent at end-line, 24 percent at baseline), 58 percent points increase in separating sick and healthy birds (75 percent at end-line, 17 percent at baseline), and 71 percent points increase in not borrowing birds from infected areas (91 percent at endline, 20 percent at baseline).  14  4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome Rating: Moderate 4.1 The institutional capacities built to prepare for, prevent, and control HPAI and other zoonotic diseases are expected to be maintained by DLS and DOHS, which was demonstrated by the additional budget allocation by the Government. DLS has a high level of commitment in maintaining the AICP structure. GON is also highly committed, as reflected in the FY11/12 budgetary allocations to maintain key HPAI activities, such as surveillance and communication. Although there is a concern whether DLS could maintain the same level of active and focused surveillance in 26 high-risk districts, an effective surveillance model for HPAI and other emerging zoonotic diseases would be developed by the proposed follow-on AHIF support. There is also a risk whether the public health BSL2 laboratory at NPHL as well as isolation wards at the NRH would be made fully operational in light of inadequate staffing. This, however, would be followed up by the Nepal Health Sector Program (NHSP II, SWAp supported by IDA and other partners). 5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance 5.1 Bank Performance (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 5.1.1 The project design followed the GPAI, including the results framework and partnership with UN agencies. Lessons learned from the on-going Bank-supported HPAI projects or those in Nepal were incorporated, in particular, procurement and M&E. However, project design would have been stronger if planned laboratory investments had been better aligned with local financial and human resource capacities (i.e., if the scope of works was limited to BSL2 laboratories rather than including two BSL3 laboratories). The results framework could have better captured all aspects of the PDOs, and dedicated support for M&E activities during implementation would have been desirable. (b) Quality of Supervision Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 5.1.2 AICP had a slow start-up. Much needed hand holding support in FM, procurement, and safeguards was provided regularly by the Kathmandu-based Bank team throughout implementation. The Bank team maintained a cross-sectoral technical team, including a Kathmandu-based Public Health Specialist (for majority of the project life) and an animal health specialist based in Australia, who closely monitored implementation through weekly audio conference with DLS. However, because the Bank’s implementation support until MTR in July 2009 focused heavily on the cancellation of two BSL3 laboratories, QAG felt that there was not adequate policy dialogue in long-term development of AI and zoonotic disease prevention and control mechanisms. The quality of supervision was, thus, rated as “moderately unsatisfactory” 15  in August 2010 by QAG. Because the GON had a strong interest in these laboratories, discussions related to cancellation of these labs created tension between GON and the Bank team. Once the GON agreed to cancellation, the Bank team was able to intensify its focus on strengthening poultry surveillance in all 26 high-risk districts and upgrading nine key national and regional laboratories to BSL2. In the last 6 months of the project, with the departure of the Kathmandu-based Public Health Specialist in end-2010, the Bank team ensured that sustainability would be addressed in the Government’s Second HPN and HIV/AIDS Program. The Bank team worked closely and effectively with other partners during implementation (WHO, FAO, UNICEF, and USAID), and adopted a joint approach to supervision discussions. This inclusive approach to program oversight facilitated project restructuring at mid-term. (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 5.1.3 The overall Bank performance was moderately satisfactory. The discussions between GON and the Bank team related to the construction of two BSL3 laboratories were timeconsuming but ultimately resulted in a desirable outcome from a cost-benefit perspective. Although sustainability of BSL3 was flagged during the appraisal, cost benefit should have been considered during the project design. However, as this was an emergency project that was developed on the assumption of a potential global HPAI pandemic, cost benefit estimates at appraisal might not have been relevant during implementation. 5.2 Recipient Performance (a) Government Performance Rating: Satisfactory 5.2.1 The GON set up an inter-sectoral task force. By early-2006, a National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan was prepared, and GON gave its endorsement. Because HPAI became mildly endemic in Nepal, GON maintained a high level of ownership and commitment in HPAI prevention and control, which was demonstrated by the specific budget allocation for DLS, DOHS, and NHEICC for the current fiscal year. (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 5.2.2 DLS had a high level of ownership in AICP. The Project Coordinator changed only once, and the latest coordinator still remains in AICP’s structure that is maintained by DLS. DOHS, on the other hand, had frequent turnover of the Project Coordinator but retained the Deputy Project Coordinator throughout implementation. Although DLS and DOHS slowly built capacities in project management, FM, procurement, and M&E, implementation was delayed frequently, in particular, procurement, and procurement-related agreed actions were often not undertaken on a timely basis. There was a high level of coordination among DLS, NHEICC, and UNICEF in implementation of the communication component starting with the project launch. Such coordination was also observed at the district level in responding to outbreaks, which engaged 16  both district DLS and DOHS in the DAITEC. At the national level, however, the primary responsibility for coordination was with DLS and DOHS. (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 5.2.3 AICP successfully contained 10 HPAI outbreaks, and the institutional mechanisms were built to prevent and control HPAI and other zoonotic disease outbreaks at DLS and DOHS. DLS is highly committed to maintain these mechanisms, which enabled rapid response to the recent HPAI outbreak in November 2011. However, implementation of this emergency operation was overall slower than expected, and the public health BSL2 and isolation wards at NRH were not fully operational by time the project closed. 6. Lessons Learned 6.1             Key lessons learned from AICP are as follows: Investment in BSL3 should have been carefully considered at appraisal. Despite GON having a high interest in constructing two BSL3 laboratories, their sustainability, including cost benefit, should have been more carefully analyzed at appraisal. Such analysis should be undertaken when considering investment in highly sensitive as well as sophisticated infrastructure. Effective risk communication enabled rapid response. In containing HPAI outbreaks, AICP mobilized local CSOs, such as youth or political groups, to ensure transparency among backyard poultry farmers on culling and compensation. The project also managed media through local and national daily briefings during containment. This was also supported by training for media spokespersons. DLS highly values communication activities in enabling communication and prevention and has mainstreamed these activities in the Directorate of Extension Services and Training. High level of cooperation among DLS, NHEICC, and UNICEF ensured satisfactory implementation of the communication component. The three agencies set up a communication task force soon after the project became effective and worked closely in developing common prevention messages and focusing their delivery in 26 high-risk districts. As a result, HPAI awareness rate has increased from 61 to 82 percent. The KAP survey could be a strategic M&E tool. UNICEF undertook three KAP surveys during project implementation, which were complemented by annual minisurveys. Although these surveys were centered on the CB-SEP, it was a good practice to regularly obtain feedback from target populations. Close collaboration with UN and donor technical agencies strengthened the institutional capacities in disease prevention and control. The project worked closely with technical agencies (including FAO, WHO, UNICEF), and with other development partners (USAID) in developing a response plan, enhancing preparedness, and building capacities in disease surveillance, diagnosis, response (containment or case management), and communication. Joint supervision with USAID enhanced coordination of planned project activities between the IDA-supported AICP and the USAID-supported H2P. Engagement of UN agencies should have been facilitated prior to GPAI implementation. Even though it took only two weeks to declare the project effectiveness, it took about a year to contract UN partners since then. This led to delay in 17  initial start-up and implementation of key activities. Issues such as overhead cost, audit requirement, and contracting processes should have been addressed between the Bank and these agencies at headquarter levels, prior to the GPAI implementation at the level of individual countries. This should be noted for future projects with heavy UN agency involvement. 7. Comments on Issues Raised by Recipient/Implementing Agencies/Partners 7.1 The Bank distributed the draft ICR to the GON as well as concerned partners based in Nepal. The comments that were received indicated that the draft ICR was acceptable and there were no specific comments. Overall, as far as the contribution of this project is concerned, the response of the recipient, implementing agencies and partners was positive and favorable. With the support of this project, GON officials felt that they were not only able to control 10 HPAI outbreaks but were also able to strengthen institutional capacity. The Recipient was more generous with its ratings for both the Recipient as well as the Bank and rated their performances as satisfactory. GON was very keen to finance two BSL-3 laboratories in Nepal through this project but was unable to achieve this goal. Given the complexity, long time involved and substantial resources needed, authorities did realize that this project was not in a position to finance the establishment of two BSL-3 laboratories before the project closed. The Recipient is pleased that there is a good possibility for Bank financing a follow-up project that will focus on zoonotic disease prevention and control, which would be financed through a grant from the Trust Fund dealing with HPAI.  18  Annex 1.

Animal Health This component directly contributed to achieving PDOs by: (i) developing an institutional capacity in HPAI surveillance (prevention), (ii) developing five SOPs in stamping- out operation, surveillance, quarantine, laboratory control, and waste management, and reviewing three legal frameworks to enable prevention and control activities (preparedness and planning); and (iii) strengthening DLS capacities in diagnosis and quarantine at central and regional levels, successfully containing 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry birds, and providing compensation to affected farmers without any delays (response and containment). Sub-component A.1 Surveillance. This sub-component developed a national random serosampling program and collected 50,000 samples from both commercial and backyard poultry 23  farms in almost four-and-a-half years of project implementation. This was almost 80 percent more than the planned 28,000 samples. The surveillance activities were focused in all 26 highrisk districts by building institutional as well as grass-roots capacities at regional, district, and village levels. More than five thousand one hundred and thirty seven veterinary professionals, para-vets, poultry owners, and wildlife technicians were trained on HPAI prevention and control and bio-security. This exceeded the original target of 3,600 persons by 43 percent. Likewise, about 18,800 villagers were trained in participatory disease surveillance, which also exceeded the original target of 16,000 persons by 18 percent. At the district level, 332 surveyors were trained on intensive surveillance (10 surveyors per high-risk district and four surveyors per medium-risk DITs and an additional 6 mobile surveillance supervision teams. These 12 teams were attached to five regional directorates and DAH in Kathmandu. Sub-component A.2 Prevention and Containment. Because nine out of 10 HPAI outbreaks in Nepal seemed to have originated from poultry trades with India, it was critical to strengthen quarantine offices.47 All nine quarantine offices (one central and eight regional48). The project expanded physical facilities of all quarantine offices by providing 8 pick-ups, 22 motorbikes, 7 computers, 23 fridges, 2 deep freezers, 33 fumigation pumps and surveillance kits. These facilities, in particular transportation, were originally envisaged for 24 quarantine check-posts at border to strengthen decentralized surveillance and detection. However, they were kept mostly at quarantine offices or District Livestock Service Offices, particularly pick-ups and motorbikes, because of overall lack of transportation facilities at the regional and district levels. The prevention and containment mechanism was proven successful, as the project contained 10 HPAI outbreaks in poultry birds. It was also tested by eight simulation exercises in collaboration with USAID and FAO (two exercises were financed by AICP). The project also organized two quarantine workshops in Jhapa and Kathmandu. Poultry farmers, traders, livestock officers, public health officers, and other government officers, such as customs, quarantine, and police participated in these workshops. The Indian quarantine officers also participated in the workshop in Jhapa. Sub-component A.3 Laboratory Capacity. The project enhanced CVL to achieve 90 percent consistency in rapid test results with OIE reference laboratory by mid-2009. AICP also strengthened diagnostic capacities by upgrading all eight veterinary laboratories to BSL2, including CVL, which was originally to be upgraded to BSL3 (cancelled at restructuring). Thirty two laboratory specialists (15 veterinary laboratory scientists and 17 technicians) were trained. Sub-component A.4 Field Veterinary Services. This sub-component trained one RRT per district for all 75 districts in Nepal on containment, including culling, safe disposal, and stamping out. In addition, 150 RRTs were also trained in stamping-out operations. The establishment of a vaccine  47  During the HPAI outbreaks in Pokhara (Kaski district in Central Nepal) in January 2010, the RVL (in Pokhara) detected at least two strains: one was sub-clade 2.2, which originated in India or Bangladesh, and another was clade 2.3.2, which was transmitted by migratory birds (the same strain detected in China, Vietnam, and Japan). See the attached link for more information on clades. http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/3/08-1190-f1.htm 48 The eight regional quarantine offices are located in Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa, Krishna Nagar, Biratnagar, Rani, Birjung, Sirciya, and Birgang Jeetpir, and each office oversees two to three districts.  24  bank was planned but the idea was dropped in July 2009 as a result of the technical committee decision. Sub-component A.5 Compensation fund. The SOP for compensation was developed in January 2007. The rate was set at NRS 100 per poultry (irrespective of age), NRS 0.5 per egg, and NRS 5 per kg of feed. The flat rate for all birds was to facilitate prompt payment, within five days for backyard farmers and 35 days for commercial farmers.49 The compensation rate, however, had to be revised during the first outbreaks in Jhapa in January 2009. Although the backyard farmers accepted this rate, commercial farmers considered it too low and refused for their flocks to be culled. The rate was, therefore, revised. For the backyard farmers, the project also provided inkind hybrid chicks. After the outbreak in Pokhara in February 2010, the flat rate had to be revised, because high-value Muscovy ducks were also affected. The farm gate price was NRS 1,050 per duck, which was 63 percent more than a layer (NRS 650 per bird) and three times more than a backyard flock (NRS 335 per bird). The revised rates were: NRS 130 per chicken (backyard or broiler), duck, or pigeon; NRS 100 per kg of poultry meat; NRS 50 per chick (backyard or broiler); NRS 10 per kg of feed; and NRS 3 per egg. Despite the Bank recommendation to increase the compensation rate for the ducks to give farmers more incentive in disease reporting, the GON maintained the flat rate to keep the compensation funds at a moderate level. In the stamping-out operations to contain 10 HPAI outbreaks, the project destroyed 28,115 poultry, 886 Muscovy ducks, 346 pigeons, 4,512 eggs, 114 kg bird feeds, and 148.5 kg meat. The compensation amounted to NRS 2,912,260 (approximately, US$41,000). For the backyard farmers, the compensation was paid without any delay as it was mostly done by RRT immediately after culling. The affected backyard farmers benefited from the in-kind compensation of hybrid poultry, because they doubled their income from sales of eggs and meat following the HPAI outbreak. A concessional credit was to be provided to commercial farmers for restocking. However, the compensation mechanism did not have accountability measures in place such as farm registration, disclosure or grievance redressal system. Component B. Human Health This component directly contributed in achieving PDOs by: (i) enhancing HPAI surveillance and diagnostic capacities (prevention), (ii) developing six guidelines which were tested during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010 and updated (preparedness and planning); and (iii) strengthening DOHS capacities in rapid response at the central and regional levels (response and containment). Sub-component B.1 Surveillance and Laboratory Strengthening. This sub-component developed six guidelines on surveillance, laboratory, infection control, clinical case management, community/home based case management, and risk communication. These guidelines were tested during the H1N1 pandemic (end-2009 to early-2010)50 and revised in October 2010. AICP set up human health RRTs, and 423 public health workers were trained on the surveillance  49  DLS proposed to use the market rate, ranging between 50 and 100 percent of such price depending on the type of birds. The use of market rate appeared problematic in determining the date to fix the price, when the price of poultry meat and eggs continued to drop due to HPAI outbreaks in India and Pakistan in mid-2006. The flat rate follows the India model. 50 According to WHO, about 220 people were infected by H1N1, but only two died.  25  guideline, which exceeded the target of 250 workers by 70 percent. Seventy five workers are also trained on the use of rapid diagnostic kits. In collaboration with WHO, DOHS enhanced the EWARS by establishing seven additional sites (out of 8 planned). EWARS now operates at a total of 35 sites, and 32 sites regularly submit surveillance reports on ILI and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI). The NPHL was strengthened and designated as the NIC. The test results were 100 percent consistent with the WHO reference laboratory.51 The planned construction of public health BSL3 was cancelled at restructuring of March 5, 2010, but NPHL was upgraded to BSL2 and validated. However, due to insufficient staffing, the O&M training was not carried out during implementation. The LIMS was also upgraded. Sub-component B.2 Prevention and Containment. This sub-component procured 3,000 PPEs and anti-viral as planned. Because these were used during the H1N1 pandemic, an additional 2,000 were procured to replenish the stock. Instead of setting up eight permanent quarantine facilities at major airport and border entry points (land routes), the project established 12 travel advisory health desks during the H1N1 pandemic. A total of 337,563 travelers were screened and 39 suspected cases were identified. It also prepared the Communicable Disease Control Act for which MOHP approval was awaited. Sub-component B.3 Health Care Delivery System Preparedness and Response. DOHS provided non-pharmaceutical intervention plans to all 75 districts, and 18 districts (24 percent) prepared their own plans with assistance from USAID-supported Humanitarian Pandemic Preparedness (H2P) Project. STIDH was designated as the NRH. The subcomponent supported establishment of 13 isolation wards and five intensive care units at national and regional response centers and provided equipment to strengthen response capacities. Moderately high cost isolation wards were established at STIDH and three other referral hospitals in Kathmandu (B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences), Bharatpur, and Nepalganj. However, two facilities (STIDH and Nepalganj) were not made fully operational, due to inadequate staffing. The sub-component also established least-cost isolation wards at nine public health facilities in Mechi, Koshi, Janakpur, Narayani, Chitwan, Lumbini, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali districts. Component C. Communication This component directly contributed in achieving PDOs by: (i) increasing the level of HPAI awareness by about 30 percentage points to achieve an 82 percent awareness rate (awareness), (ii) developing an HPAI communication strategy (preparedness and planning); and (iii) developing a risk communication model during stamping-out operations (response and containment). Sub-component C.1 Animal Health. This sub-component far exceeded the planned level of communication outreach. Because it was managed by DLS, these activities adequately supported  51  In FY 2011/2012, NPHL will participate in the external quality assurance scheme (EQUAS).  26  containment at the farm level and focused on all 26 high-risk districts. The sub-component trained 3,300 community stakeholders (poultry farmers, including women), 81 percent more than originally planned. Prevention messages were aired on one national TV and 26 local FM stations in 26 high-risk districts52 and printed in newspaper 660 times. Approximately, 400,000 posters (which far exceeded the estimate of 20,000) and brochures and 1,600 communication toolkits were printed and distributed. About 278 traders and farmers in high risk districts were also trained on quarantine and bio-security. Based on the lessons learned in managing stamping-out operations, the subcomponent trained 750 media spokespersons on risk communication and disease prevention, which was 3.3 times more than originally planned (225 persons). Likewise, 1,425 security personnel were trained on disease prevention and bio-security, which was 5.7 times more than planned (250 officers). This ensured delivery of correct AI information and prevention messages to affected communities. Although not quantified, AICP also mobilized CSOs in facilitating rapid culling operations (including youth organizations, farmers associations, and political parties). DLS was convinced of the importance of communication, and, has mainstreamed these activities in the Directorate of Extension Services and Training (DEST). Sub-component C.2 Human Health. This sub-component developed the HPAI communication strategy, which was endorsed by both MOAC and MOPH in June 2010. Communication guidelines and protocols were also developed in September 2010 and approved by the two ministries in February 2011. UNICEF’s CB-SEP was implemented in eight high-risk districts, which were Ilam, Jhapa, Sunsari, Morang, Saptari, Chitwan, Nawalparashi, and Banke (AICP financed the program in five districts). CB-SEP trained 180,000 students at 3,000 schools in these districts. UNICEF also mobilized 64 CSOs of women, micro-credit, local ethnic groups, para-legal and/or youth (eight organizations per district) and formed DDCs. About 800 committee members were trained in hand washing, AI prevention, and risk communication. Component D. Project Management DLS reviewed and revised three regulatory frameworks in providing overall framework and justification in response and containment activities, including stamping out and compensation: Veterinary Council Act, Animal Health and Livestock Service Act 1998, and Bird Flu Control Order 2007. The Bird Flu Control Order was issued under the Natural Disaster Relief Act 1982 and revised to incorporate lessons learned from the first HPAI outbreak in January 2009. DLS also developed five SOPs. The EMP, including waste management, was developed in July 2006, while the other four SOPs were developed by 2008: containment (revised in 2010), surveillance guidelines (revised in 2009), quarantine guidelines, and laboratory protocol. A total of 32 project staff at DLS and DOHS was trained on project management.  52  Nepal has 46 national radio stations, more than 75 FM radio stations (at least one per district), and approximately 17 community radio stations. The radio ownership ranges from 44 to 62 percent, and the listenership is estimated at 64 percent in urban and 50 percent in rural populations. On the other hand, the TV ownership is as low as 20 percent in urban and 1 percent in rural populations.  27  Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis 1. Several donor-supported projects were initiated in Nepal as a result of H5N1 outbreaks in the region, since late 2003 outbreaks in South East Asia, including more recently Bangladesh and India. With 24 million chickens and 0.4 million ducks, the Nepalese poultry sector today contributes nearly 3.1 percent to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is critical for livelihood of millions of rural households. About 70 percent of the poultry business is organized under commercial farms employing more than 65,000 persons. It constitutes a significant source of income for the rural poor in Nepal. Productivity in the backyard chicken market is very high, particularly in the Terai, Siwalik Hills and deep valleys of mid-hills. 2. Due to the risk posed over the poultry industry and especially over the public health, GON developed a strategic plan in 2006 – the NAIIPPRP – and an operational plan, based on which the US$18.2 million equivalent IDA-assisted AICP was approved. In addition to the AICP, FAO/USAID spent US$1.4 million since 2006; UNICEF spent US$550,000 on AI communications (with US$150,000 from Japan, US$100,000 from DFID and US$300,000 from Canada); and USAID spent about US$200,000 through international non-government organizations (NGOs), investing also on in-kind PPEs to support AI control on human health aspects. 3. While complemented by the achievements from other projects, AICP was instrumental in consolidating and strengthening the country’s successful preparedness to contain HPAI outbreaks. This annex outlines and identifies the benefits and costs of these efforts, and presents an economic analysis relating these costs to the most direct benefits identified from project activities targeted at human health and at poultry issues (in terms of economic value loss avoidance). An economic and financial analysis of AICP was not undertaken during project preparation or restructuring of the project. Project Costs 4. At project closure, AICP costs were about US$14 million from IDA. With parallel projects spending about US$2.2 million, total investments related to AI preparedness and control in Nepal were about US$16 million. GON incremental recurrent costs beyond 2012 were estimated at US$500,000 per year for incremental salaries, materials, and other O&M costs. These investment costs were compared with the value of some quantifiable benefits to assess if the investments were justified and the results are provided below. Project Benefits 5. Benefits were derived from the development of the project’s pandemic preparedness and continued vigilance for heath security, sustained people’s livelihood, and ultimately economic development. For quantifying these benefits two scenarios were considered (“With” and “Without” Project) in order to measure, from the difference between scenarios, the loss avoidance and costs related to the damages from the disease. 6. Poultry Sector Project Benefits. With about 22 million poultry in Nepal in 2010 and more than 70 percent of poultry in large commercial enterprises producing meat and eggs, the 28  project’s impact on the poultry industry was a significant decrease in the number of poultry infected and/or culled during the HPAI outbreaks and thus, the number of poultry deaths. Losses avoided included: (i) the value of poultry meat production losses avoided; and (ii) the economic value of egg production loss avoidance plus the value of the layer birds at the end of their productive life. Average value of live bird farm gate price of NRS 255 was used, multiplied by the number of broiler deaths averted, assuming that 50 percent of chicken deaths would be broilers. An average 154 eggs/bird/year, multiplied by the farm gate egg price of NRS 0.80/egg and the number of layer deaths avoided, assuming that 50 percent of deaths are layer hens, plus the meat value of a layer hen at the end of her productive life (set at 50 percent the value of a broiler) multiplied by number of layer deaths avoided (assuming that 50 percent of chicken deaths are layers) allowed for estimating the project benefits. 7. The avoidance of the cost of culling and replacement programs under both scenarios was also included resulting in an additional benefit. At the time of the 2010 outbreak, the GON compensation per bird was NRS 100 per bird for losses, which represented only 17.8 percent of the average cost for SOP application in the ten Nepalese outbreak sites occurring in 2009 and 2010. From the calculation of the ten situations with varied poultry population, the average cost of stamping out one bird was around NRS 680 and the percentage share of the different activities involved were; hired transport 11.3 percent, cost of equipment and drugs 31.2 percent, salary and wages 31.5 percent, compensation to farmers 17.8 percent and contingency 7.6 percent. Based on these costs, for the present analysis, SOP cost of US$10 was considered for the culling and associated costs. Project results based on these assumptions are presented below. 8. Human Health Project Benefits were not quantified although the project has also a significant impact by preventing, until now, the spread of the disease; and in the future, by potentially decreasing (or hopefully completely avoiding) the percentage of the human population infected by HPAI. Losses avoided would result in this case, from reducing the number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths attributed to HPAI53. Benefits could thus be also expressed in terms of loss avoidance, and include the economic value of: (i) hospitalization costs averted, (ii) avoidance of income loss from days lost due to illness, and (iii) income loss avoidance from fatal HPAI cases (average value of remaining lifetime earnings expressed as the present value of annual take-home income over an average 15 years discounted at 12 percent). Another major unquantifiable project benefit is that the program put in place - in response to the HPAI project - a strengthened country’s preparedness program to respond not only to future outbreaks of HPAI outbreaks, but also of other zoonoses and highly infectious diseases, especially through the implemented communications and awareness programs, as well as the training and capacity building. This was demonstrated during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009  53  The affected human population (Gross Attack Rate) for an outbreak of HPAI could be estimated at a percentage of the population being hospitalized and a percentage of death for those affected both under the “Without Project” and the “WithProject” scenarios. However, these parameters are difficult to estimate, and it was not possible to obtain practitioners to provide estimates because of inadequate and incomplete statistical data and information to base their estimates. For the economic analysis, the economic value of human health losses avoided was therefore not considered.  29  and 2010 to which the general population as well as the medical specialists reacted very calmly because the health system had the experience, information and means to cope with the situation 54. 9. Other Possible Non-quantified Benefits are (i) an avoidance of a decrease in GDP growth; (ii) the avoidance of an increase in foreign exchange requirements for imports of poultry meat and eggs (and possibly other substitute food products) during the crisis period; and (iii) the avoidance of economic losses to consumers because of price increases (cross-price elasticity effects) for other livestock products. These were not analyzed because of data constraints. However, the effects in terms of economic losses are likely to be very high due the importance of tourism in the Nepalese economy. 10. The scenarios for the analysis:  Under the “With Project situation” the infection rate during the 2009-2010 outbreaks GAR of HPAI resulted in about 0.3 percent of the poultry population infected and/or culled because the project had been adequately implemented and a preparedness system was in place, and worked properly. On this base, this scenario assumed that GAR would affect 0.3 percent of the poultry population every year, but its spread would be contained and controlled as was the case in the 2009-2010 outbreaks55.  In the “Without Project scenario” it was assumed that the 2009-2010 outbreaks would have had a huge level of infection that could have resulted in an infected/culled rate of 17 percent of the poultry population with 100 percent mortality of the birds involved. These estimates are based on what actually happened during the 2003-2004 outbreaks in Vietnam with no preparation – where about 45 million birds (17 percent of about 265 million) either died from HPAI or were culled56. Although not every bird culled might be infected by HPAI, the recommended practice is to slaughter all birds in a flock or village where an outbreak is confirmed. For purposes of analysis, thus, all birds culled are deemed to have been infected and killed as a result of the HPAI outbreak.  54  The awareness campaign through TV and radio targeted high risk districts at border areas, and a Trans-border Workshop for quarantine and security officers was conducted at the Nepal-India border. 55 The mortality rate remains 100% for the infected birds: the project did reduce the number of poultry deemed to be infected because of the improved diagnostic and detection capacity and the ability to contain outbreaks, but it may not decrease the mortality rate once a flock is infected. For now, Nepal appears to be holding bird flu at bay, but no one can assure it will stay that way. The control measures help, but illegal poultry trade poses a risk of reintroduction of the virus. 56 There have been three main waves of outbreaks in Vietnamese poultry since late 2003, with 93 confirmed human cases and 42 deaths: (i) from December 2003-March 2004, 45 million poultry were culled and 27 human cases were reported, 16 of which were fatal. At the peak of the epidemic in early 2004, around 24 percent of Vietnam's communes and 60 percent of towns were affected, in 57 out of Vietnam's 64 provinces. Seventeen percent of the poultry population died or were culled. Scattered outbreaks and a small number of human cases continued through November 2004; (ii) from December 2004 to March 2005, 2 million poultry were culled and 64 human cases (21of which were fatal); (iii) from October to December 2005, 4 million poultry were culled and 2 human cases were reported. Around 8 million of Viet Nam's 11 million households were estimated to be engaged in poultry production prior to 2003. It is estimated that the direct economic impact of HPAI amounted to about 0.12 percent of Vietnam’s GDP in 2004 alone, representing the net effect of the negative impacts on the poultry sector compensated to some extent by the increase in substitute livestock production. The total cost of the epidemic in the first two years has been estimated to be around US$630 million.  30  11. The “With Project” scenario estimates that 0.3 percent of the poultry population could be infected every year and would die from HPAI or be destroyed by GON order, while “Without Project” it was assumed that – as in the case of Vietnam – 17 percent of the birds would have been culled after the 2009-2010 outbreaks. It was also assumed that without the project, after the outbreaks the GON would have then reacted by implementing an AICP starting in 2010. For the analysis, the value of poultry losses avoided was calculated with the assumption that an HPAI outbreaks would occur every year from 2009 onwards, mainly due to illegal imported birds, using the above mentioned GAR and other parameters. These parameters are considered as likely during a severe outbreak of HPAI in the poultry industry, as happened in Vietnam without project in 2004-2006. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis 12. The analysis related AICP costs to the benefits from the economic value stream of losses avoided from project activities in the poultry industry - expressed as the expected value of the economic loss avoided from outbreaks in a 7-year period (2008-2014). Project benefits are assumed to remain realizable over the period and beyond, attributable to the project expenditures on laboratories, equipment and awareness programs and the increase in human capital from the project’s training activities. The market prices used for poultry products are considered to be economic prices, because the markets, for the most part, operate freely without production quotas and subsidies for poultry or poultry inputs. Wages and other market prices used in the analysis are also assumed to be economic prices. Under the “Without Project” scenario it was assumed that after the 2009-2010 outbreaks - with about 17 percent of the poultry population being lost the GON would have immediately implemented an AICP to contain further outbreaks. Consequently, by 2014 after its completion the “with” and “without” situation would become the same in terms of preparedness, control and results. 13. Table 1 below presents the project’s costs, benefits and results of the economic analysis based on the above assumptions and parameters for the poultry sector losses avoided. The results are highly robust, with a 311 percent ERR and NPV of US$34.8 million. The results did not quantify the human health benefits, the economic value of human health and life loss avoidance. 14. A sensitivity analysis concerning the GAR in the poultry sector in the “Without Project” situation during the 2009-2010 outbreaks was undertaken, and results are shown below. The economic returns to the AICP are highly robust, even under highly conservative parameters (1 percent of GAR under the 2009-2010 outbreaks) that severely restrict the benefit estimations. It clearly confirms that from an economic point of view, project was worth undertaking.

Beneficiary Survey Results 1. The KAP survey was conducted in early-2011 in selected five high-risk districts (Ilam, Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, and Chitwan), where UNICEF implemented the CB-SEP. Almost 770 families participated in a household survey, including 3,070 school children, in both intervention and non-intervention Village Development Committees (VDCs). In addition, 200 students, teachers, poultry farmers, village leaders, health workers, social workers, and political leaders participated in 20 focus group discussions at district and village levels. The survey was conducted by UNICEF, in collaboration with the NHEICC under the MOHP. 2. School children. Almost all children in the intervention and non-intervention VDCs reported that they washed their hands regularly (99.3 percent in non-intervention and 99.4 percent in intervention areas). While only 16.2 percent of respondents in the intervention areas washed their hands after sneezing at baseline, 93.5 percent of them did so at end of the project. In the intervention areas, more children washed hands after touching birds, from 55.4 percent at baseline to 94.2 percent at the end of the project. 3. The children in the intervention VDCs are more knowledgeable of the signs and symptoms of pandemic influenza: 86.6 percent indicated coughing; 86.6 percent indicated sore throat; and 89.1 percent indicated fever. In the non-intervention areas, 51.0 percent responded coughing, 16.3 percent did sore throat, and 83.7 percent did fever. 4. Similarly the knowledge of 4 major prevention methods of pandemic influenza is also increased among the children across the districts. The study showed that the percentage of respondents who could identify the 4 major prevention methods of pandemic influenza from the non-intervention VDCs were, covering nose and mouth while sneezing and coughing (23.2 percent), one meter distance from sick person (15.2 percent), use of mask (33.3 percent) and washing hands with soap and water (11.1 percent). The children from the intervention mentioned the 4 key preventive measures were covering nose and mouth while sneezing and coughing (92.6 percent), one meter distance from sick person (88.2 percent), use of mask (89.0 percent) and washing hands with soap and water (81.6 percent). The hand washing, use of mask, avoiding crowd and coughing messages was key massage during intervention and led to improvement in knowledge about key indicators among intervention area. 5. The survey describes the source of information on bird flu and revealed that 47.5 percent respondents from non-intervention VDC and 49.2 percent respondents from intervention VDC received information about bird flu on the radio while 66.2 percent respondents form non-intervention VDC and 78.4 percent respondents from intervention VDC received information from TV. Similarly 22.7 percent from non-intervention VDC and 29 percent from intervention VDC received information from health workers. Similarly, reading materials were also found to be a source of information for children since more than 40 percent of the children mentioned that books are also one of the major sources of information for them in both intervention and non-intervention VDCs. Further, 35  teachers, health worker and family members also mentioned children as a source of information. As part of the media habit, the children were also asked about language in terms of easy to read, write and understand. The majority of the children both from nonintervention and intervention VDCs mentioned Nepali (86.6 percent non-intervention and 92.7 percent in intervention VDCs) on any issues. This was followed by Maithili and Tharu, which can also be used in some parts of the districts to reach hard to reach communities. 6. Household members. The hand washing knowledge and practice among the farmers is 100 percent in both the non-intervention and intervention VDCs. Similarly the hand washing practice after touching poultry was also about 44.0 percent and 90.0 percent in non-intervention and intervention VDC respectively. 7. The knowledge of backyard farmer and their families on 3 key measures to prevent bird flu was high in intervention VDCs. Only about 20 percent of farmers among non-intervention VDC and 80 percent of farmers among intervention VDC report to a veterinary doctor or call them if chickens get sick. Nearly 27.1 percent of farmers from non-intervention VDC and 75 percent of farmers among intervention VDC separate sick and healthy birds. Almost 33 percent of farmers from non-intervention VDC and 91.2 percent from intervention VDC stated that bird flu can be prevented by discouraging illegal importation and movement through restriction of entry of sick birds from the infected area. The knowledge on three major sign and symptoms was also relatively low among families. Regarding the knowledge of signs and symptoms of pandemic influenza, coughing (17.8 percent), fever (31.5 percent), and sore throat (15.1 percent) were considered signs and symptoms of pandemic influenza among backyard farmer families in non-intervention VDC. However, in intervention VDC, coughing by (92.5 percent), fever (91.2 percent), and sore throat (87.5 percent) were considered signs and symptoms of pandemic influenza. 8. The majority of farmers stated that covering the face while coughing and sneezing (17.8 percent in non-intervention VDC and 84.8 percent in intervention VDC) and use of mask (45.2 percent in non-intervention VDC and 79.7 percent in intervention VDC) can prevent pandemic influenza. Regarding the social measures to control pandemic influenza, about 17.8 percent of farmers from non-intervention VDC and 82.3 percent of farmers from intervention VDC stated that by avoiding crowding can prevent epidemic of pandemic influenza. The four measures to prevent pandemic influenza must be a priority for the communication intervention to educate the families on pandemic influenza. In both intervention and non-intervention VDCs the information is inadequate for the families on pandemic influenza.  36  Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results DLS organized a Stakeholder Workshop in June 2011. About 100 people participated in the workshop, including MOAC representatives, DLS Officers, poultry associations, FAO and the World Bank. Summary of discussion, including lessons learned, was as follows:           The participants congratulated the project’s achievements in successfully containing 10 AI outbreaks in poultry. Communication is critical in preventing and controlling the spread of AI outbreaks. The project developed a communication package targeting poultry farmers. In controlling future outbreaks, DLS mainstreamed the communication activities under the training and extension directorate. Rapid response was facilitated by cross-sectoral cooperation at the district level. There was a high level of cooperation among media, local governments, CSOs (such as local political parties and youth associations), and the public health sector in stamping out operations. The partnership with media, in particular, ensured transparency by providing the correct information. Compensation in cash and in-kind enhanced livelihoods of backyard farmers. The affected backyard farmers promptly received cash and later hybrid birds. As a result, these farmers almost doubled their income with the sales of eggs and meat. However, the commercial farmers have not yet fully regained their stock. They took cash but not in-kind compensation. The project had high level support and ownership from MOAC and DLS throughout project implementation. It was suggested that MOAC strengthen: (i) diagnostic capacity by establishing BSL3, (ii) bio-security at commercial farms, (iii) risk communication, and (iv) epidemiology.  37  Annex 7. Summary of Recipient's ICR 1. With the arrival of highly pathogenic HPAI in neighboring countries, India and China in 2006, the threat to Nepal significantly increased, as the country shares a long and porous border with these countries. In early 2006 the GON endorsed NAHIPPP, which was a joint human and animal health plan providing a strategic framework to prepare for and respond to this threat. As a results, an implementation plan was developed to enhance animal and human health, and communication. The GON requested the support of the World Bank (IDA) to finance AICP to be implemented over a fouryear period from FY2007/2008 to FY2010/2011 at an estimated cost of US$18.20 million or NRS 1.33 billion. 2. The overall objective of AICP was to minimize the threat posed by HPAI in Nepal by: (i) controlling such infections among birds, especially domestic poultry and (ii) preparing for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic and related emergencies. AICP envisaged three types of interventions: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning, and (iii) response and containment in case of AI outbreaks. The projects closed on July 31, 2011 in all its four components: (i) Animal Health; (ii) Human Health; (iii) cross-cutting communication and (iii) Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation. 3. Implementation. The GON also requested FAO to assist in the implementation of the animal health component of the project by providing technical assistance and equipment provision under an agreement which covered the period from August 2008 to July 2011. FAO’s technical assistance focused on the following sub-sectors of AICP program:  Design and monitoring of construction of a BSL3;  Surveillance and epidemiological investigation;  Strengthening of animal quarantine services;  Strengthening of the capacity of veterinary laboratory work;  Strengthening of veterinary field services; and  Project management 4. Although the design for the BSL3 laboratory was produced but this component of AICP program was dropped on the recommendation of a World Bank MTR. Consequently, the project concentrated on enhancing bio-safety and technical capacity at CVL and regional laboratories. This was facilitated through an extensive program of technical assistance inputs, capacity building and specialized equipment provision. CVL is now fully capable of a wide and detailed range of HPAI diagnostic techniques, including molecular virology and virus sequencing. 5. The capability of the veterinary epidemiological centre has been expanded through the introduction of tools that facilitate animal disease data management (TAD info) and visualizing data through mapping (GIS) combined with Information Technology (IT) hardware and software provision. Risk analysis has been conducted and active surveillance for HPAI developed through a targeted disease searching process. 38  6. Communications have been supported through technical assistance leading to improved awareness of HPAI among poultry farmers with the aim of improving passive surveillance through reporting of disease by owners. The cross-cutting communication component was implemented by UNICEF on a tripartite agreement between the DOHS under MOHP, and DLS under MOAC is a part of the AICP in both the Human Health and Animal Health Component of the project. 7. The GON rates the project outcome satisfactory, but the risk to development outcome is significant. The Bank and GON performance was both rated satisfactory. The project achieved the following:  AICP has been the major player in supporting GON’s activities preparing for and counteracting the incursion of AI into Nepal. The Animal Health component has been actively and substantially supported by the sub-project covered by the agreement between FAO and GON.  The processes established through AICP to develop and strengthen the capability of DLS in preventing, detecting, diagnosing, containing and eliminating HPAI should be preserved and further developed to encompass other trans-boundary diseases and emerging infectious diseases, and particularly those with zoonotic potential and thus broaden the approach to sustainable animal health systems.  Through training and equipment provision, GON has been provided with many of the tools required to further advance epidemiology and surveillance under DOH. This has included the introduction of TAD info software package to improve DLS’s ability to manage data gathered on livestock diseases more efficiently. Departmental willingness to adopt the system more widely and to integrate the system currently used for OIE data reporting could be stronger and further advocacy in this area is indicated. GIS training also emphasized integration with TAD info and VEC’s capability has been strengthened through upgraded software, computer and UPS provision and the supply of a color printer, digital maps of 74 districts and 6 GPS handsets. It should be noted that, with advances in the understanding of the epidemiology of the viruses concerned, the recommended approach to HPAI surveillance has also progressed and for that reason the project has moved towards developing a scientifically based disease searching approach to active surveillance and discouraged the collection of serum samples from healthy chickens.  FAO has fully played its part in analyzing the effectiveness of border controls to prevent entry of HPAI, and has advocated modifying the present strategy towards one which more readily accepts the realities and encourages cross-border cooperation and communication together with engagement with relevant stakeholders and traders. Although reliance on physical border control was emphasized in the project agreement with FAO, this is unrealistic and the current scientific opinion supports risk analysis and management through cross border cooperation between relevant authorities, including traders and producers, and acceptance that with a long porous and un-patrolled border alternative strategies have to be explored.  39    AICP’s interactions in the area of laboratory services has been massive and has resulted in increased competence and improved confidence in the diagnostic capacity of CVL and RVLs. However, more needs to be done in the areas of laboratory equipment maintenance, the management and procurement of consumables for both HPAI diagnostics and differential diagnostic needs. The regional laboratories are capable of doing more detailed diagnostic work and should be so engaged.  8. Lessons learned. The following summarizes key recommendations and lessons learned.  Surveillance directed at HPAI lends itself to adaptation to the detection of other major economic and zoonotic diseases and this should be considered by DAH and VEC in order to justify the considerable cost of effective surveillance.  Maximum advantage should be taken from the positive outcomes of AICP to demonstrate to GON decision makers, particularly and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the importance of the livestock sector in general and the poultry sector in particular to the livelihoods of a significant proportion of the rural population and to the economic health of the country as a whole.  AICP’s activities in the field have unearthed an immense number of individuals and households who are entering small scale commercial poultry production with inadequate knowledge and experience of husbandry practices relating to housing, nutrition, management and marketing of poultry which in many cases leads to excessive losses and poor production. There is a significant pool of technical capacity in and around Chitwan district and the veterinary faculty at Rampur which could be engaged to develop and multiply a force of poultry extensionists to support and guide this expanding trend.  The policy relating to cross border trade should be reviewed and, rather than a blanket ban, a strategy of defined entry points with minimum facilities for inspection of live birds should be considered. The entry points should be operational throughout daylight hours (at least) and manned by uniformed quarantine office staff with powers to detain birds or refuse entry, and equipped and trained to conduct rapid antigen tests for HAPI and ND and in the collection and dispatch of laboratory samples for further testing. The aim would be to work with traders and facilitate entry at those points while maintaining a prohibition elsewhere backed up by regulations. A mechanism must be in place to ensure no unauthorized charges are levied at the inspection points. The legislation banning direct cross border importation of poultry and poultry products from India should be amended to reflect this change.  Internal movement control and inspection points need to be made effective and can operate in the same manner as described above for cross border inspection points. Signs displayed at inspection points, border or internal, should clearly indicate that charges are not to be levied and give a telephone number, ideally toll free, as in the case of the system operated by DAH bird flu monitoring cell, where contravention of this rule may be alerted.  Passive surveillance should be encouraged. Communications should be given more emphasis within the DLS and awareness campaigns stressing the advantages 40               of interaction with the field service staff promoted. Field staff in turn must be encouraged to communicate effectively with poultry keepers to address their demands and needs and to diligently investigate rumors of poultry mortalities. Rapid testing at DLS labs and by surveillance teams should be considered with appropriate safeguards. Active surveillance must be closely targeted in order to arrive at a process that is affordable and sustainable while retaining sufficient sensitivity. The interface between field technician and farmer must be optimized through training in participatory rural communications, reinforced periodically. Maximum advantage should be taken of the high quality staff at RVLs to expand the range of poultry diseases which they can diagnose, always with safeguards, to ensure cases are not missed. A continuous training program for RVL officers and laboratory technicians should be developed by CVL. A major problem at the moment is the failure of CVL to provide those who submit of samples for diagnosis with any response. The target should be for an immediate response for HPAI and ND with an indication of what further examinations are being carried out, where these are negative, and at least initial bacteriological and pathological results within 96 hours accompanied by advice on management and treatment. Failure to provide these results discourages farmer cooperation. Continued training for VEC officers is recommended to maintain and expand capability in risk assessment, management and reduction and to keep them up to date with surveillance techniques. The DLS may benefit from greater collaboration with the private sector both in developing sustainable approaches to disease detection and containment, and to jointly lobby GON to ensure wider understanding of the value of animal health services as well as its “public good” role, so that realistic budgets are set for key activities such as surveillance and laboratory operation. The DLS should also seek to improve links with the public health services, agencies dealing with wildlife and other relevant agencies recognizing that under a “One Health” banner disease control programs may be more efficient and carry more weight in negotiations with GON. Even though there had been provision to hire a private firm for M&E, importance focused on the technical side and, as a result, AICP suffered in reporting the progress on technical implementation and evaluation the report in a timely manner.  41  Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders The draft ICR was distributed to all the partners/stakeholders who have been actively involved in different aspects of HPAI in Nepal and have been working closely with the World Bank. They found the draft ICR report acceptable but did not provide any specific comments. Overall, partners/stakeholders were pleased that both the GON and the Bank promoted their involvement in all issues related to HPAI and recognized their valuable contribution.  42  Annex 9.

Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative. The Public_Communications_Policy_(PCP) recognizes that transparency and accountability are essential to development effectiveness. It establishes the disclosure requirements for documents and information ADB produces or requires to be produced. The Accountability_Mechanism provides a forum where people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can voice and seek solutions to their problems and report alleged noncompliance of ADB's operational policies and procedures.

***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The pace of urbanization in Nepal has increased markedly during 2001 2011 with an urban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national population growth of 1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was estimated to live in urban areas, up from 9.2% in 1991 and 13.9% in 2001. While global experience clearly demonstrates that urbanization is an important driver of economic development, the potential has not been adequately tapped in Nepal. In the absence of a stringent policy regulating and managing growth, uncontrolled and haphazard urban development has created numerous problems, including deficiencies in basic urban services; environmental degradation; encroachment on public land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement development. Most municipalities in Nepal lack properly engineered and operated sanitary landfills, and have limited and intermittent water supply services, poorly maintained road infrastructure, and inadequate drainage systems that cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai. The Local Self Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to municipalities, but the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a low level of institutional capacity make providing infrastructure facilities commensurate with the growing demand for services a major challenge. Poor health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by reducing labor productivity and educational attainment. Disease, associated economic burden, and premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable. **** Impact **** Improved urban environment in the municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Population in project municipalities have inclusively better access to improved municipal infrastructure and services. Progress Towards Outcome There are 10 consulting service packages in total: project management and support consultant (PMSC) in the PCO; GESI consultant for the GESI Unit; design and supervision consultants (DSCs) for the four project municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar; and local nongovernment organization (NGO) services in the four project municipalities. Contracts have been awarded for all. Technical Bid Evaluation for the drainage and road subprojects at Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar is in stage of finalization at PCO. ADB has already provided no objection to issue IFB for SWM projects at Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj. Design and Bid document of Dharan water supply project has been finalised. Similarly the design of the drainage and road project at Janakpur has been finalized and draft bidding document has been prepared. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs 1. Reliable municipal infrastructure developed 2. Community development programs undertaken and GESI capacity strengthened. 3. Project management and administration supported. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress TBER of the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj drainage and road subprojects are in final stage at PCO. Final design and draft bidding document of Janakpur drainage and road subproject has been prepared. Progress mentioned above. ADB has already provided concurrence to issue IFB for the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj SWM Subprojects. Regarding Janakpur SWM sub project, site has not yet been finalized due to social issues. To early to report. Design and Bid document has been finalised with a target to publish IFB by end of Oct 2014. Progress mentioned above. Project implementation is being done in this direction by mobilizing NGOs in Dharan, Janakpur, Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj Municpalities. 84 TLOs and 3 Users committee formed have more than 33% of women representatives. Community developement proposals will adreess this issue. GESI operational guidelines is finalized and toolkits developed for the same. Log frame of GESI project is prepared. This has been done. PCO and PIUs formed and core staff appointed. Aduit report and quarterly reports are being submitted timely. Being complied though there is some delay in Janakpur sub projects. Implementaion ongoing in this direction. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: B Indigenous Peoples: C **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect The project is classified as environmental category B. Four initial environmental examinations including environmental management plans were prepared in accordance with ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws, and disclosed. Subprojects are not located in or near sensitive or protected areas, and the initial environmental examinations conclude that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management plans provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of short duration. The net environmental benefits will be positive and large, including reduced (i) urban flooding from improved drainage systems, (ii) environmental pollution from improved SWM, and (iii) health and hygiene status as well as the overall environmental sanitation situation of the selected povery clusters of the project municipalities will be improved through various software and hardware activities under small scale community infrastructure. Implementation arrangements in the PCO build on experience gained through ADB urban projects, and consultant support will enable the PIUs to manage environmental impacts. The PCO will provide environmental reports to ADB semiannually. The project had alredy submitted Semi annual environmental safeguard monitorting report covering the period of Jan-June 2014. This has recently been disclosed in ADB's web site. Involuntary Resettlement The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Three draft resettlement plans were prepared in consultation with affected persons in accordance with the ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed. The project requires minor land acquisition for construction of sanitary landfills and temporary impacts on vendors during construction, with no significant resettlement impacts anticipated. Special assistance measures will be made available to vulnerable groups. The resettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO, and adequate consultant inputs have been made available to support implementation and build capacity to managing resettlement impacts and social risks. The project has been reporting compliance to social safeguard related issues by the PIUs in the quarterly as well as semi anuual social safeguard monitoring report to the ADB. The third semi annual safeguard monitoring report covering the period of Jan-June 2014 has already been submitted. Indigenous Peoples The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Considering the urban locations of these subprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Urban services are limited outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations restrict further development in the valley, and there is an urgent need to improve the environment in potential urban centers to promote social and economic development in other regions of Nepal. The government, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the basis of (i) economic growth potential, (ii) demand for urban services, and (iii) urban management capacity. The project directly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP and Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work as catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the employment-centric, equitable, and inclusive economic growth emphasized by the approach paper. Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differentials in the needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets experience discrimination based on gender, caste, and ethnicity, and multiple exclusions constrain their progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is limited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress has been made through support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development partners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. During Project Implementation The project is in line with the Nepal country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity building, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. Reflecting lessons from similar projects, the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically integrated components, to simplify project administration and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable development impacts; (iii) fully involves stakeholders, including communities, in project identification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before project implementation; and (v) addresses enforcement of appropriate regulations as an essential element of managing urban infrastructure effectively. Therefore as envisioned by the Project, the project coordination office and project implementation units are doing consultation with the concerned stakeholders as and when needed and also been disseminating the relevant project related information to the public. Also due consideration has been given for the meaningful participation of the concerned project stakeholders in reaching project related decisions.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 15 Dec 2010     * Fact-finding: 24 Aug 2011 to 06 Sep 2011     * Management Review Meeting: 06 Oct 2011     * Approval: 14 Feb 2012     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The TA supports ADB's Energy for All Initiative, which develops new approaches for scaling up access to energy for the poor, in line with ADB's commitment to inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. The TA will pilot test the SMB approach to increase the number of improved water mills by helping poor households gain access to local financing, technology, and know-how to enable financially viable but nonbankable projects to become bankable. The key feature of the SMB approach is the establishment of a revolving fund to provide a menu of "gap-filling" finance (e.g., equity, debt, bridge financing, lease-toward- purchase, and partial credit guarantees) to entrepreneurs to mobilize local financing for income-generating, small-scale energy investments. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** ADB's country strategy and program (CSP) for Nepal is focused on providing access to economic opportunities to foster-based growth, with a special focus on the needs of the poor and excluded in rural areas. **** Impact **** Access to sustainable, reliable and affordable modern energy services improved in target communities in Nepal **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Results of social merchant banking (SMB) approach to financing improved water mills demonstrate the viability of scaling up access to energy projects Progress Towards Outcome Implementation is ongoing. The TA consultants have identified geographical areas to benefit from SMB financing through the IWM program. These will be engaged and targeted upon the establishment of the revolving fund. The Clean Energy Development Bank (CEDB) was selected as the host of the revolving fund through competitive procedure and pursuant to the criteria stipulated in the TA. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs SMB model piloted in some IWMP districts Capacity built among local partners, e.g., entrepreneurs and microfinance and financial institutions, to implement sustainable energy service delivery programs Revolving fund capitalized and deployed on a pilot basis to provide gap-filling finance for energy service investments. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Both the international consultant, with direct experience in applying the social merchant banking approach, and the national consulting firm - CRT/N are officially on board. Minor changes in implementation arrangement were approved by Director, SAEN on 26 Feb 2013 to reflect the following: (i) CEBD as the host of the revolving fund; (ii) APF in lieu of IA; (iii) reallocation of TA funds; and (iv) extension of TA closing till 30 Oct 2013. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Consultation with project stakeholders will be an important part of project implementation. These will be consulted through design and into implementation. During Project Implementation Consultation with stakeholders will continue throughout implementation of the project.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.

Component B: Modernization of the observation networks and forecasting This component has five subcomponents: i) Technical modernization of the observing networks, ii) Modernization of DHM’s communication and ICT systems, iii) Improvement of the numerical hydro meteorological prediction system, iv) Design and pilot operation of an environmental monitoring network, and v) Refurbishment / reconstruction of DHM offices and facilities. Component C.: Enhancement of the Service Delivery System of DHM The subcomponents of this components are: i) Introduction of a Public Weather Service (PWS) for (DRM, agriculture, media, civil aviation, health, energy, water resources, irrigation), ii) Strengthening of DRM operations including piloting of “end-to-end” early warning systems in two river basins in the western and eastern parts of Nepal, iii) Improvement of service delivery (i.e. warnings and advisories) to communities including introduction of mobile applications, and iv) Establishment of the National Framework of Climate Service Component D: DHM climate and weather information for users in agriculture – Agriculture Management Information System It has five subcomponents: i) Agriculture Management Information System – Portal, hardware and software, ii) Information products, iii) Information dissemination, iv) Capacity building, v) Project management, social and communication, monitoring and evaluation of component D.  iii  The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) will implement Component A, Component B, and Component C under the coordination of the Ministry of Environment, Science, and Technology (MOEST). Ministry of Agriculture Development (MoAD) will implement Component D of the project. Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared for social and environmental management of project activities during implementation, and is consistent with Nepal's environmental and social policies and requirements as well as policies of the World Bank (WB). Fragile geology, unstable steep slopes, high topographic variation, frequent change in river course, cloud burst, climate change impacts have put Nepal at high risk to natural hazards. Floods, landslides, droughts, wildfires take place recurrently causing immense damage to property and loss human life. The country losses of properties equivalent to US $ 8 million, 4000 hectors of fertile land and displacement of 20 thousands and death of around 300 people every year due to hydro meteorological disasters1. Once River systems reach the Tarai Region, they often overflow their banks onto wide floodplains during the monsoon, shifting course periodically. The rivers are deeply-incised across the east-west structural grain of Nepal and the Himalaya, having eroded with the upliftment of the mountains. Precipitation is generally concentrated in the regions below 500 m. Precipitation is relatively low in High Mountain and High Himalaya (Sharma, 2003)2. It indicates that the occurrence of flooding in the Tarai and Churia is comparatively higher than in high elevation zones. Furthermore, the districts in Tarai are prone to floods (Very high risk-Mahottari; High risk- Rautahat, Chitwan, Parsa, Saptari, Siraha, Sunsari, Dhanusha, Bara)3. Nepal is divided into three ecological regions: High Mountains (35 % of total area), the Middle Mountains (42% of total area), and the Churiya and Tarai (23 % of total area). The distribution of forest land coverage is as follows: 23 % of total forest land in Mountain, 50 % in Hill and 37 % in Terai. On an average, forest land has decreased at an annual rate of 1.7 %. Soil erosion and flooding are the major causes of land degradation in the country. Nepal ranks at 25th position in terms of biodiversity with 11 bio-climatic zones, 118 ecosystems and 35 natural forests4. Sixteen protected areas (17% of the country's total area) including national parks (9), conservation area (3), wildlife reserves (3), and a hunting reserve (1) and six buffer zones have been established for the protection of flora and fauna. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture as approximately 66 percent of the national population is engaged in agriculture. The country has 2.97 million ha gross cultivated land and 2.64 million ha net cultivated land. The cultivated lands have been distributed into: 52% in Terai, 40 % in Hill and 8% in Mountain. With 65% of cultivated land in the slopes of hills and mountains where loss of fertile topsoils due to erosion is common. Loss of topsoil due to erosion, pollutants, improper use of pesticides and insecticides, and deforestation are leading factors of declining soil fertility in the country.  1  Paudel, D. 2006  2  Sharma, 2003  3  GoN 2010.

Haphazard solid waste collection and not handled properly in recycling process and disposal system causes significant adverse impacts on public health and the environment, contamination of surface water, ground water and soils as well. In the absence of proper landfill sites, the collected waste is directly dumped in rivers or forest and agriculture areas. There are no separate arrangements for managing hazardous waste. The scrap battery to be 2030 metric tons for the year 1998 and projected such battery scrap to 110-190 metric tons for 20085 in the country. About 1.8 million Population live in mountain, 11.5 million in hills and 13.4 million in Tarai. Multiethnic and multilingual country with as many as 102 ethnic groups and 92 languages is in the country. The country's current poverty level is 25.4 percent. 95.5 per cent of poor people live in rural areas and the incidence of poverty in rural areas (28.5 percent) is almost four times higher than that in urban areas (7.6 per cent). At national level, only 5 % of the population hold 27 % of lands of size 3 ha or more. About 51 % of the population confined 59% of land of size 0.5-3 ha. Likewise, about 44 % of the people hold 14 % of land of size less or equal to 0.5 ha.  The Gender Parity Index for secondary school net enrollment has also increased from 0.87 (2007) to 0.98 (2010). Quota-system brought in over 33 percent of women in the Constituent Assembly. The maternal mortality rate declined from 538 in 1996 to 380 per 100,000 live births. Although the legal age of marriage is 20 for both male and female, it is hardly implemented in Nepal. Some key programs such as Social mobilization and empowerment, Income generation through microenterprise promotion, Community infrastructure, and Capacity building and human resources development have been emphasized to reduce poverty in the country. Environmental and social concerns (adverse impacts) of the project are not likely to be highly significant. However, minor adverse environmental and social issues/ impacts are likely from the project e and are related to few activities such as upgrading the meteorological stations (if it requires lands on an ideal condition-equivalent to 0.06 ha), installation of Weather Radar System (WRS), utilization of dry-cell battery for power supply system to operate hydrological and meteorological sensor in automated operation mode. Upgrading of existing hydrological and meteorological stations, installing WRS will include small scale interventions such as surface improvements (removal of vegetation up to 5m x 5 m for Gauge House, 8 m x 8m for Cable House, 25 m x 25 m for automated weather station in an ideal condition 10 m x 7 m in normal condition, and 60-100 m2 lands for Radar) and utilization of dry-cell battery of 12 V (170 batteries, 7 kg weight per battery). Use of huge machinery interventions or heavy machines is notrequired for any activities of the project. The likely environmental adverse impacts due to these small scale interventions are s trees/plants/vegetation loss when forest clear, solid waste and pollution which could causes health 5  DANIDA/COWI, 2003 Study on Environmentally benign Handling, disposal and recycling of used lead-acid batteries in Nepal  v  hazards, agriculture/crops damage around the meteorological stations and access to them, and site specific erosion risks. Some of the devices such as batteries, barometers, thermometer etc may contain hazardous substances. The e-wastes and used batteries, although the quantity is likely to be small, could be source of hazardous substances containing toxic chemical and heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, nickel, acid that pose direct or indirect risks to environment, wildlife and human health. Impact of modernization of hydrological stations on river water quality and quantity is non-existent or negligible as no water will be withdrawn and the envisaged improvements/ modernization activities will be very small in scale (activities such as few meter river bank protection around the station, installation of simple flow measuring equipments, construction of steeling wells on the river banks and access to flow measuring station). The environmental beneficial impacts of the project are likely to be expected in several aspects such as improved mitigation and preparedness measures in disaster risk management, promoted scientific understanding through reliable data and information, improved agriculture practices and security. The social adverse impacts of these small scale interventions are likely to be minimal and varied according to the type of lands (government, and private), type of social groups (marginal farmer, vulnerable groups), and educational status and gender imbalance. Furthermore, disturbances in lands, less opportunity for unskilled workers, health hazards are likely to be happened in terms of social adverse impacts of the project. The land required will be primarily taken on lease or donated voluntarily against a token amount and part time employment. In very few cases land may be acquired which will be very small in size. Although small in size, the lands are of great importance to vulnerable groups in terms of living and livelihood. In this situation, based on the eligibility criteria and type of losses, the affected families/individuals need appropriate compensation as well as resettlement and rehabilitation assistances by adopting land acquisition process of GoN and resettlement policy framework of WB (see below). Compensation Entitlement Matrix Loss Category Loss of Trees and Crop  Entitlement Unit Landowner       Land given on voluntary basis  Registered Owner     vi  Description of Entitlement At least three months advance notice for crop harvest In absence of advance notice, cash compensation based on annual value of the produce and calculated according to the Department of Agriculture norms (crop compensation) Cash compensation based on annual value of the produce and calculated according to the Department of Forestry (for trees compensation) Onetime payment as grant equivalent to one year of minimum agriculture wages Employment as part time operator to one member of the household preferably to the  Loss Category  Entitlement Unit  Loss of agriculture land, if any  Registered owner       Loss of agriculture land, if any  Non titleholder     Loss of House or other property  Property owner (title holder)    Loss of house or other property  Loss of Income or source of income  Encroachers / squatters  Eligible household         Description of Entitlement woman of the house Cash compensation at replacement cost Any transfer costs, registration fees or charges Compensation for crops and trees if any Subsistence allowance equivalent to one year of minimum agriculture wages Compensation for crops and trees if any Subsistence allowance equivalent to six months of minimum agriculture wages for loss of livelihood Compensation at replacement cost or as settled by users’ organization and PAP or committee under District Administration Office. Shifting allowance of NPR 5000 as one time grant. Resettlement assistance of NPR 50000 Compensation for the structure build on government land at replacement value One time grant of NPR 5000 as shifting allowance. Resettlement assistance of NPR 50000 Subsistence allowance equivalent to one year of minimum agriculture wages  Major issues of vulnerable people including indigenous people are: likelihood of inclusions in the project, involvement in capacity building process, exclusion from information and knowledge etc. The project will adopt policy addressed towards inclusion, greater participation, capacity building through the project. Key gender issues are: likelihood of less participation of women, powerless and marginalized people in different kinds of trainings and information dissemination program, low level of literacy to understand the information; less chances of job opportunities for unskilled worker, women and the member of marginalized communities etc. ESMF outlines the areas where women need special supports/assistance and ensures women's participation to benefit from project subcomponents. The social beneficial impacts of the project are likely to be expected in several social issues such as improved employment opportunity (about 87,500 man days will be engaged for short term work), Capacity building of communities, agencies in early warnings, additional supports for marginalized people (relatively remote locations which are the preferred sites for upgrading the hydro meteorological stations and these groups are likely to be more beneficiaries of the project), improved lifestyle (through improved weather and climate information in agriculture production and food security), improved technical knowhow of farmers.  vii  The ESMF has been prepared by considering the relevant GON regulatory and policies and the WB safeguard policy. The relevant framework/policies of GoN are: Environmental Protection Act and Regulation 1997, Forest Act 1993 and Regulation 1995, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 and Rule 1996, Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization act 1987 and amendment 1992, National Agriculture Policy 2004, Local Self Governance Act 1999, Land acquisition Act (1977) and Regulation amended in 1992, Gender and Child Rights mainstreaming Guidelines 2005. Likewise the WB relevant safeguard policies are: Environmental Assessment, Forestry, Natural Habitats, Involuntary Resettlement, Physical Cultural Resources, and Indigenous People. The land acquisition process is generally lengthy (almost a year) if the project needs private lands. Public lands (Government Lands) need to be given a high priority to implement subcomponent of the project. Similarly, non availability of effective regulatory measures to manage for e-wastes is a major challenge. This framework includes: Environmental and social screening of the sub components; Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), Framework for Vulnerable Community Development; Consultation Dissemination Framework; Institutional Arrangement Framework; and Framework for Monitoring and Mitigation and Adverse Impact. Each subcomponent of the project will go through environmental and social screening in order to identify relevant environmental and social concerns and suggest further investigation/ assessment if necessary. Once the subcomponents are screened against all these criteria they will be categorized as per the nature and magnitude of impacts: the ineligibility criteria include core protected area, world heritage sites, and conflicted/disputed territory. Subproject/activity located in the protected area, but out of core area, may be permitted on written permission from the competent authority. Preliminary or full environmental assessment may be necessary for Category A and Category B subproject/activity, and management/safeguard plans needs to be prepared. The sub components will consider alternative designs (especially during site selection) in order to avoid land acquisition and minimize adverse social impacts. A resettlement action plan with the cost of land acquisition will be prepared during the implementation after screening subcomponents as per the guideline of WB. The compensation and allowances cost will be estimated during the implementation of the subcomponents of the project. Following key requirements need to be taken into account to implement subcomponents of the project.      Consultation especially for installation of WRS needs to be carried out in screening and developing the project. PMU is responsible for the consultation. Some activities such as installation and enhancement of stations in environmental sensitive areas such as National Park, Conservation Areas, Ramsar area, protected forests and other protected area is permissible only if written permission from the authorized officials is obtained through due process and meeting all requirements. PMU will coordinate with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservations and/ or other relevant or competent party/ agency. The activities should not be implemented in areas with high risk of landslides, floods and erosion. PMU need to consult with the concerned agencies such as Department of Soil  viii            Conservation and Watershed Management (DOSCWM) and Department of Water Induced Disaster Prevention (DWIDP), Department of Mines and Geology (DoMG) Internal monitoring need to be carried out by PMU/DHM periodically and reported to the Director of the Project. Project will carry out environmental compliance review once in sixmonth. PMU need to consult the key stakeholders of the project such as disaster management agencies including government, non-government, NRCS; managers, media, academician, farmers, and service oriented agencies especially tourism, aviation etc Collection of Battery, e-wastes and other hazardous wastes from the stations/sources to the nearest collection center (Basin Offices/Regional Meteorological Offices/the DHM office at Kathmandu) by utilizing outsources and by Department's staff during regular monitoring period. The project will give preference to non-hazardous or the least hazardous alternatives available in purchasing devices and use of systems (for example mercury free alternatives in battery, thermometer, barometer etc, where possible or hybrid batteries that are less risky). Early in the first year of project implementation, hazardous waste collection, recycling and management system with due consideration to the risks of the hazardous wastes including from batteries will be developed and put in place. One option is to use the auction process for recycling, which will be carried out by PMU according to the government's rule and hazardous wastes management and handling protocol/ procedure specifically developed for this project during the first year of implementation. Out of 170 batteries, about 35 batteries may need to be collected two times and the rest one time during the project period. The compensation cost including allowances for affected land/property owners (crops/house loss) will be estimated during the implementation of sub-component. PMU is responsible for the estimation of the costs by consulting local market and Cost Determination Committee at district level. Mid-term Evaluation and Final Evaluation of social and environmental safeguard management need to be carried out in second year and the last year during the project period. PMU is responsible to facilitate administrative process for the selection of national evaluators.

In current practice social and environmental safeguard management issues are not systematically addressed as there are no human resources to address social and environmental safeguard issues at the department. DHM is not equipped with capacity due to insufficient organizational set up and lack of trained manpower in the field of environmental and social science. MOAD, another implementing agency of the project has Gender Equity and Environment Division which helps Project Management Unit (PMU) in MOAD to address social issues in the project. Project Management Units (PMU) has been proposed at both implementing agencies (DHM and MOAD). PMU will include technical, financial, procurement, environment and social specialists as may be required..

Introduction 1.1 Background The Government of Nepal (GoN) has prepared Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR), which was approved by Climate Investment Fund (CIF). Nepal’s SPCR identified five areas/components for investment. The investments outlined in the SPCR are expected to help Nepal to manage many climate risks discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The areas of investment identified by SPCR are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.  Building Climate Resilience of Watersheds in Mountain Eco-Regions, Building Resilience to Climate-Related Hazards, Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in Development, Building Climate Resilient Communities through Private Sector Participation, and Enhancing Climate Resilience of Endangered Species.  The World Bank is identified for administering SPCR Component 2 i.e. Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards. Accordingly, preparation of the project on Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards (BRCRH) has begun with some preliminary and prerequisite activities, one of them being the study presented here. The project aims to develop a strong capacity to monitor and forecast hydro-meteorological events and climate variability, and to deliver this information in timely and user-friendly manner to the key clients (including farmers and disaster management professionals). Activities funded through the project would help improve decision-making and planning in key climate vulnerable and water resources dependent sectors, particularly agriculture, and contribute to building resilience for communities and sectors at risk. The need for a well-functioning early warning system has been identified as a key priority in the Government of Nepal's National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management. At present, much of Nepal's hydrological and meteorological system relies on manual data collection with infrequent and unreliable reporting. Agro-meteorological information is another urgent priority to manage and mitigate climate risk in Nepal's large and highly vulnerable agriculture sector, and to underpin the country’s food security efforts. Seasonal climate predictions are currently not available in Nepal, which DHM aims to develop within the framework of this project. The study has been carried out in accordance with the scope of work for the study on "Preparation of Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards-Pilot Programme Climate Resilience (PPCR) under Environmental Impact Assessment Programme" by Nature’s Conservation Pvt. Ltd., a leading National Consulting Firm working on hydrometeorological & environmental issues and development sectors in Nepal. The agreement between the department and the Consulting Firm was held on 13th March 2012 (30 Falgun 2068 of the fiscal year 2068/069  1  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  1.2 Objective of the Work The main objective of the consulting service is to prepare Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for the Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards Project (BRCRHP). Since the subprojects are known, this framework will provide guidance to prepare safeguards documents during the implementation stage.  1.3 Scope of the Work The scope of work includes the following: Environmental assessment of the overall project Review Legislative and Regulative, policies, Considerations Review of Existing Environmental Management Practices Institutional and Capacity Assessment Development of Environmental Management Framework (EMF) including Institutional arrangement for implementing EMF; Capacity strengthening plan; Consultation framework; Carry out a rapid review of social issues involved and make broad-based social assessment of the program/project (focusing on components and likely activities listed in the pre-feasibility study), highlighting potential positive and negative impacts of the program/project. Review policy and acts/ regulations of Nepal and the World Bank (OP 4.10, 4.12) in order to identify applicable provisions in the proposed program/project and suggest ways to fill any gap between Nepal and World Bank requirements. Assess the capacity of the institutions involved in the project, including the roles and responsibilities of implementing agencies, and offer guidelines for capacity development to address any gaps. Analyze and assess possible conflict, political economy factors and governance risks that could potentially affect project implementation, and offer recommendations to mitigate these risks and challenges. Key issues that will be dealt with will include: assessment of the political environment; stakeholder mapping and analysis; conflict analysis; and other governance factors that could influence the operating environment for the project; Assess gender and social inclusion considerations related to project activities. This will include: identification of key gender and inclusion related participation issues; identification of possible roles for women and disadvantage (or vulnerable groups) in project objectives and activities; examine the differences in knowledge, attitudes, practices, roles, status, wellbeing, constraints, needs and priorities related to gender and other differences; assess the potential for  2  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  differentiated impact of project based on gender and exclusion and identify options to maximize benefits and minimize adverse effects; Develop a communication and consultation strategy for in line with the overall communication and consultation strategy developed for the project to ensure that the project affected people as well as the vulnerable groups, including women, benefit from the effective and timely delivery of hydro-meteorological events and climate variability envisaged in the project; Develop a Social Management Framework (SMF) for the Program/Project implementation (fulfilling requirements for Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), Vulnerable Community Development Framework (VCDF); and Gender Development Framework)  1.4 Methodology Adopted The Environmental and Social Management Framework has been prepared by adopting several processes: Consultation with Project Implementing Agencies; Scoping of the Project through Public consultation including the stakeholders and project affected people; and review of relevant policies, and regulations (Table 4.1).

The study team also consulted the International Team of Vaisala, a Finnish Company that develops, manufactures products and services for environmental measurements including hydro-meteorological equipment. The Vaisala Company has supplied some automatic weather measuring instruments to DHM. In this regards the study team had met with the member of the company to know about the potential impacts of the key activity of the project like Automatic Weather measuring instruments. 1.4.1.2Districts selection for public consultation The following districts were selected in a consultative meeting held on 4th April, 2012 at Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) by considering resource and time limitations. The representatives from the department, Ministry of Agriculture Development (MoAD) and the consulting team participated in the meeting. The selected districts (Figure 1.1 and Table 1.2) are representative of both the basins as well as the entire country and cover most of the social and environmental issues of the proposed project under PPCR.

The local organizations were identified by Natural Disaster Management Forum Nepal (NDMF Nepal), a member of national level network (Disaster Preparedness Network Nepal-DPNet Nepal). The identified local organizations were Society for Community Development (SOCOD Nepal) in Lamjung, Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) Bardiya District Chapter in Bardiya District and Malagiri Development Center in Ramechhap District. The issues discussed in the public consultations and suggestions & feedback received from the participants are described in Chapter 4 in brief and in Appendix of this report in details. 1.4.2.1 Focus Group Discussion (FGD) at Community Level The objectives of these consultations were to:     understand the concerns of beneficiaries and primary stakeholders, including community members, indigenous groups, women, Dalits, the disabled, elderly, landless about environmental and social issue of upcoming project; dissemination of the project objectives to identify the issues and possible impacts of the activities of the project 6  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards    community's perception about the existing hydromet station Network and its services  A total of four FGDs were conducted in three sampled districts. The participants included farming community, district and community level government agencies, and station part-time DHM staff. The list of participants are listed in the report (Annex 1.1).The perception of the participants about the issues was gathered using structured and non-structured checklist for FGD (Annex 1.2). 1.4.2.2 Key Informants Interview (KII) at Individual Level Interactions with indigenous community and vulnerable groups were carried out at the field level. This step resulted in the identification of key issues, assessment of the needs of the indigenous people and women. Separate individual interviews were carried out with vulnerable members, HMS data recorders/observers, meteorologists, hydrologists, instruments handling field based practitioners/persons, key leaders at community, farmers etc. The interactions were used to share information about the project, understand their views about the project and its potential impacts. Ideas were explored on how the project could provide assistance to targeted groups and to the local development through the planned services. Discussions were also carried out with DHM part-time observers/gauge readers to know their experiences including problems and issues regarding existing hydro meteorological monitoring networks at field level. 1.4.2.3 Stakeholder Meetings/Workshop at District Level The district consultations workshops were carried out in Lamjung and Ramechhap. Primary and secondary stakeholders including representatives of local government bodies, non-governmental organization, media, political parties, security agencies, etc. participated in the workshop. Likewise, district level meeting chaired by Chief District Officers was conducted in Bardiya district. District level government officers including NRCS district chapter participated in the meeting. The name of participants is listed at Annex 1.1. The steps adopted in the workshop are described in the annex (Annex 1.3). 1.4.2.4 Site observation and informal Interaction The consultant teams visited the existing hydromet station site to assess the ground situation and community's perception about the existing stations. The consultant team with the local community also visited the possible sites of Automatic Weather and Hydrological Service Networks, and Radar system. B) Consultation at Central Level A stakeholder consultation discussion was carried out by conducting a workshop at central level. The purpose of this consultation was to share the project objectives; discuss on the findings regarding environmental and social issues relevant with the subcomponents of the project, share the environmental and social management framework of the project, and gather suggestion/feedback on the framework. A detailed procedures and the outcome of the workshop is described in Appendix. 1.4.3 Review of Documents The documents reviewed and referred to include: 7  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards       Government of Nepal environmental and land acquisition legislation and operational guidelines Project documents related to Climate change, hydro meteorological services (HMS) social and environment sectors Early Warning System Guidelines, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) documents, World Bank Operational Policies  1.4.4Analysis and Presentation of Results The qualitative information gathered from the workshop through structured questionnaire was analyzed. A spreadsheet program was used for frequency count of the responses. The perceptions of the community about the project were quantified. The environmental, social, economic and agronomic issues identified are presented in Chapter 4.  1.5 Limitation of the Work The following are the limitations of this study.       The issues related to the project were collected in specific areas from the selected districts, which could not be generalized for the nationwide issues. Because of inadequate connectivity of DHM with locals, district level agencies and community's unfamiliarity with the HMS related instruments (simple and advanced equipments), community had difficulties in expressing their views about the project impacts. Stakeholders in the districts were also not familiar with the simple and advanced technologies like HMS networks and the equipment including the RADAR. Political disturbance like unexpected shutdown disturbed the field visits affecting the collection of data and information.  8  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  2. Project Description This chapter deals with project description in terms of project subcomponents and their key activities. The detailed activities (about 60 activities) of subcomponents (about 22 subcomponents) are given in Annex 2.1. The potential environmental and social implications of subcomponents of the project are also described in details in Annex 4.1. The potential subcomponents that are concerned with environmental and social aspects are presented in this chapter.  2.1 Project Components, sub-projects and Activities The project has been described in terms of components and potential subcomponents (Table 2.1).The project includes four components: Component A, Component B, Component C, and Component D (Table 2.1). DHM will implement the project components A, B, and C. MOAD will implement Component D. The consulting team consulted with the department to identify specific subcomponents and activities. According to DHM, specific subcomponents and detailed activities with possible locations will be identified during the project implementation phase. The potential subcomponents and possible activities under each subcomponent are identified by reviewing the project documents provided by the department. There are about 17 subcomponents including three subcomponents in Component A, five in Component B, four in Component C, and five in Component D (Table 2.1). Table 2.1 lists-out key activities concerning environmental and social sensitivity.  9  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Table 2.1: Project components and their subcomponents Key Activities Highlighting the environmental and social sensitive aspects  Potential Subcomponents  Components A: Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building and Implementation Support of DHM Objective: to strengthen DHM‘s legal and regulatory frameworks, improve institutional performance as the main provider of weather, climate and hydrological information for the nation, built capacity of personnel and management, ensure operability of the future networks, and support project implementation.   Institutional Strengthening  DHM capacity building and training  Systems design and integration, project management and monitoring  Component B: Modernization of the observation networks and forecasting Objective: The objective of the component B to modernize DHM observation networks, communication and ICT systems, improve hydrometeorological numerical prediction systems and refurbish DHM offices and facilities.    Technical modernization of observation networks   Modernization of DHM‘s communication and ICT systems   Improvement of the numerical hydrometeorological prediction system  Design and pilot operation of an environmental monitoring network  Refurbishment / reconstruction of DHM offices and facilities  10  Re-equip of the hydrological stations-74 hydrological system will be automated Improvement of the Environment of Hydrological sites Installation of Weather Radar Unit/System Installation of Automated Weather Stations (AWS)- up to 100 Weather System (Sensor based equipments).

Relevant Policies and Regulatory Mechanisms This chapter deals with regulatory, legislation and policy and practices of Government of Nepal (GON) and World Bank. (WB) This chapter also focuses on the policy gaps between GON and WB.  3.1Background In the context of the project 'Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards (BRCRH) -under PPCR' implementation, Government of Nepal's policies, acts and regulations were reviewed. Similarly the review process included the World Bank's Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies. Attempts have been made to assess the relevance, adequacy and effectiveness of the current policies and regulatory provisions. Attempts have also been made to identify measures to improve the effectiveness of these provisions with regard to environmental and social aspects. There are a several laws related to environment and social issues. The issues are directly and indirectly concerned with disaster management, application of hydro-meteorological services, and agriculture information management. In addition, some of the sectoral laws address some environmental and social issues. The details of the reviewed policies and regulatory mechanisms are attached in Annex 3.1.  3.2. Relevant Policies Of these policies highlighted in Annex 3.1, the policies relevant with the project are briefly explained below. 3.2.1 Policies of Government of Nepal Environment Protection Act and Regulations 1997 have made IEE and EIA mandatory for the development projects. The list of development projects requiring IEE or EIA are given in the regulations. The provided list indicates that the regulations are applicable for BRCRH project. Forest Act 1993 and Regulation 1995 are applicable for the project if subcomponents require forest lands. The regulation stipulates that the project is responsible to pay the compensation if it causes loss or harm to any local individual or community. Similarly, the entire expenses required for the cutting and transporting the vegetation products in a forest area used by the project shall be borne by the operators of the project6. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 highlights the prohibited activities in a project area. Activities are not allowed in protected areas (National Park, Conservation Area, Wildlife Reserve, Hunting Reserve, Strict Nature Reserve and Buffer zones) without a written permission from the authorized officials. In this regards, it is advisable to avoid such areas while developing a plan to implement the subcomponents of the project. The rule (Conservation Area Management Rule 1996) helps in screening the subcomponents of the project by assessing negative listings. Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization act 1987 with amendment in 1992 describes the procedures for disposing solid waste. The act categorizes harmful hazardous wastes and provides 6  http://www.forestrynepal.org/images/Forest_Act_of_Nepal_1993.pdf  13  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  information on several controlling measure. There is provision to appoint inspection officer for checking and monitoring solid waste control and management. The inspector has authority to take action against the polluter or polluting agency. Disposal of battery and electronic goods can be carried out on the basis this act but it does not provide specific guideline for the disposal of such wastes. Auctions are the procedure usually followed to dispose these wastes. The amendment of this act in 2011 is under the process of endorsement. National Agriculture policy 2004 gives special priority to the development of the pockets of high-value agricultural products. The local bodies have the rights and responsibilities for the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of agricultural plans in their respective areas. On the basis of this policy, farmers' groups receive on-site extension services. Resource centers are developed and strengthened for producing local seeds, seedlings, plants and improved breeds. The proposed project can play an important role in strengthening the centers by capacity building in the application of climate information into agriculture practices. Information and Communication Policy, 2059 (BS) has developed long-term policies on information and communication sectors. The project can benefit from these policies as media can be mobilized in sharing the subcomponents and its outcomes to the concerned stakeholders. Private and government related mobile companies can be supportive as well as beneficiaries from this project through this policy. Climate Change Policy GoN, 2001 addresses the issues of climate adaption and disaster risk reduction. Fforecasting water-induced disasters and reducing created from climate change and providing early warning information for disaster management are some of the key points of the policy. The policy provides some guidelines to address the issues of vulnerable communities in the context of reducing their risk to climate related disasters. Land Acquisition Act, 1977, Land Acquisition Regulations, 1969 amended in 1992 empowers the government to acquire land for development purposes by paying compensation to the landowner. The land acquisition for subcomponents of this project can be acquired by means of these regulations. Local Self Governance Act, 1999 provides more autonomy to District Development Committees (DDC), Municipalities and Village Development Committees. According to the act, DDC has authority to coordinate for screening and assessment of the subcomponents. The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007: The Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007) includes provisions that support gender equality and social inclusion. It has a separate article for women’s fundamental rights (Article 20) and is inclusive toward Janajatis, Dalits, and Madhesis.  14  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  3.2.2Policies of the World Bank World Bank's policy on Environmental Assessment (EA) states that all projects proposed for World Bank's financing require an EA and Social Assessment (SA) to ensure that they are environmentally and socially sound and contribute to sustainable poverty reduction. Various instruments are used to perform EA depending on complexities of a project. They include Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment and Environmental Action Plan (EAP). The World Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies are the cornerstones of its support to sustainable poverty reduction. The objective of these policies is to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their environment in the development process. These policies provide guidelines for the bank and borrowers staffs in identification, preparation and implementation of programs and projects. The World Bank’s environmental assessment policy along with recommended processing is described in Operational Policies (OPs). There are (10 + 1) WB safeguard policies comprising a) Environmental Policies including OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.09 Pest Management, OP 4.36 Forestry and OP 4.37 Safety of Dams b) Social Policies including: OP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources, OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and OP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples c) Legal Policies including OP 7.60 Disputed Areas, and OP 7.50 International Waterways and d) Bank Disclosure Policy (Bank Procedure 17.50). Of these policies, the policies relevant to BRCRH project are briefly described below. Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) is conducted to ensure that Bank-financed projects are environmentally sound and sustainable, and that decision-making is improved through appropriate analysis of actions and of their likely environmental impacts. This policy is applicable for this project because some key activities especially installation of Hydrological and Meteorological stations and WRS may cause environmental adverse impacts. This policy is applicable for screening the subcomponents of the project and for evaluating project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its areas of influence. It also helps to examine project alternatives; identify ways of improving project selection, planning, design, and implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts enhancing positive impacts; and includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout the period of project implementation. Forestry (OP/BP 4.36) aims to reduce deforestation, enhance the environmental contribution of forested areas, promote afforestation, reduce poverty and encourage economic development. It is relevant to subcomponents which may be implemented in government or community forest areas. According to this policy, the Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinion, would involve significant conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical natural habitats. Some of the existing hydrological and meteorological stations lie in forest areas. This safeguard policy will help to reduce forest losses and deforestation when the stations to be upgraded in the forest region.  15  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) directs to support natural habitats while the subcomponents of the project are implemented in national parks and protected lands. This policy affirms WB’s commitment to promote and support natural habitat conservation with improved land use and the protection/ rehabilitation of natural habitats. In the context of BRCRH project natural habitats may comprise of many types of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. They may include areas lightly modified by human activities, but retaining their ecological functions and native species. WB does not support projects that involve significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats. Some of the existing hydrological in the protected regions forest areas. This safeguard policy will help to promote natural habitat conservation when the stations to be upgraded in the forest region. Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) policy is to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement where feasible, exploring all viable alternative project designs; assist displaced persons in improving their living standards, income earning capacity, and production level, or at least, in restoring them; encourage community participation in planning and implementing resettlement; and provide assistance to affected people regardless of the legality of land tenure. The policy provides guidelines for mitigating the adverse effects of development projects including social and environmental impacts such as land acquisition, relocation, loss of occupations and income sources, productive assets as well as community resources. As highlighted in the project description, some key activities of this project may require private lands. Thus this policy is applicable when private lands are used to implement the subcomponents of the project. Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) policy is to assist in preserving Physical Cultural Resources (PCR) and in avoiding their destruction or damage. PCR includes resources of archeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious (including graveyards and burial sites), aesthetic value. Cultural resources are important as sources of valuable historical and scientific information, as assets for economic and social development, and as integral parts of a people's cultural identity and practices. The loss of such resources is irreversible, but fortunately, it is often avoidable. This policy may govern while implementing the VRCRH project at some locations which requires special attention while selecting sites. Since the site for installing WRS has not been identified, this safeguard policy helps in guiding to select the sites in cultural resources areas. Indigenous People (OP/BP 4.10) Policy is to: (i) ensure that indigenous people affected by World Bank funded projects have a voice in project design and implementation; (ii) ensure that adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples are avoided, minimized or mitigated; and (iii) ensure that benefits intended for indigenous peoples are culturally appropriate. This policy underscores the need for Borrowers and Bank staff to identify indigenous peoples, consult with them, ensure that they participate in, and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally appropriate way - and that adverse impacts on them are avoided, or where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. This policy is applicable for several subcomponents which need to be implemented in areas where there are significant presences of indigenous people/vulnerable present. The discussions are summarized in the following table (Table 3.1).  16  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Table 3.1: Applicable World Bank Environment and Social Policies World Bank Policy  Applicable due to  Addressed in ESMF  Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)  Project is likely to have impact on both social and natural environments  Preparation of detailed environmental management framework address the environmental and social issues  Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04 )  Some activities will include national parks and/or protected forests and surrounding locations  Preparation of an environmental management plan to address impacts on biodiversity (flora and fauna)  Forestry (OP/BP 4.36)  Project will involve limited clearance of some government, community of private forest areas  Preparation of an environmental management plan to address impacts if any on forest areas  Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)  Project may require agencies/privates land  Preparation of a Framework for appropriate compensation or Resettlement Action Policy/Plan  Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11  Project may locate in culturally significant areas, since; the site for WRS is not fixed.

Brief discussions about the conventions are given below.  17  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity7 Nepal is a signatory to this convention that came into force in Nepal as of 21 February, 1994. To implement this commitment, Nepal is making efforts to develop national plan for biodiversity conservation and management, to identify and monitor biodiversity and establish a network of protected areas. Nepal is also attempting to include biodiversity as an essential component in environmental impact assessments. The convention calls for the adoption of national strategies, plans, and proogrammes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into their relevant sectoral plans. Agenda 21 Nepal is implementing “Agenda 21”, a non-binding international statement of goals and principles. It asks countries to promote activities that are well supported in Nepal, such as alleviation of poverty, improved land use, conservation of biodiversity, public participation, empowerment of women, respect of indigenous cultures, working with NGOs, development of human resources, etc Ramsar Convention on Wetlands On the basis of this convention, The Nepal Environmental Policy and Action Plan (NEPAP) 1993 have given high priority to identification and protection of marshes, wetlands and water bodies which are significantly rich in biodiversity. This plan has also recommended a study to assess the biological diversity of endemic plants and animals, both terrestrial and aquatic that occurs outside protected areas on farmlands, pastures, rangelands, forests, rivers, lakes and ponds. NEPAP is an effective initiative for the protection of wetlands and has provided a good policy foundation for development of the National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP) United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) UNFCCC provides the basis for global action" to protect the climate system for present and future generations". This convention deals with reduction of greenhouse gases and other emissions. Likewise the government as a member organization of WMO and ICAO has adopted the international guidelines relevant to the Project. ICAO Annex 3-Meteorological Services for International Air Navigation ICAO guides the provisions for meteorological observation, meteorological forecasts, meteorological warnings to pilots, aviation meteorological reports, and dissemination of meteorological Information. In order to make effective services regarding meteorological information, Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) coordinates with National Meteorological service (NMS)-DHM.  7  http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ae154e/AE154E08.htm#TopOfPage  18  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  World Meteorological Organization Guidance, 2008 WMO provides guidelines for establishing a hydrometric or meteorological station. According to the guidance, the recommended land area required for AWS is 25 m x 25 m. A series of automated sensors are sited at the recommended positions and interconnected to one or more data collection units using interfaces. About 12 V Battery is required to power an AWS. Approximately 170 batteries need to be required. The life-time of each battery is about 1.5-2 years. Selecting an appropriate site for the weather station is critical for obtaining accurate and representative meteorological data. Typically a site should represent the general area of interest, and be away from obstructions such as buildings and trees. Basel Convention, 1989 Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of Hazardous Waste and their disposal was adopted in 1989. The convention came into force in 1992 and 170 parties have been in this convention in 2008. The objectives of this convention are:        to minimize quantity and hazard of wastes generated to endure environmentally sound management and adequate disposal facilities to dispose of wastes as close as possible to their point of generation to reduce trans-boundary movements to prohibit exports from developed to developing countries to provide support to Member States  3.4 Adequacy, Efficiency of Legal Provisions The relevant policies of GON, WB and International Conventions discussed above are fairly adequate to deal with the possible issues of environmental and social concerns related to BRCRH project and its subcomponents.  19  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  4. Environmental and Social Issues This chapter deals with an overview of environmental and social issues assessment related to project components/subcomponents. The assessment includes environmental and social implication due to the project components, current situation related to the project implementation including political risk, conflicts, institutional capacity, public concerns, and gender and social inclusions.  4.1Environemtnal and Social Status of Nepal Climate and Hydrology Climate of Nepal is dominantly influenced by the South Asian monsoons. Average annual precipitation in Nepal is 1760 mm, 80 % rainfall occurs in monsoon (June to September. The winter precipitation is due to moisture coming from the Mediterranean Sea, and its intensity reduces to the east. Most parts of the country have an average annual rainfall of 1,500mm to 2,500mm, the maximum being about 4,500mm in Pokhara. A combination of sharp relief and fast-moving monsoon clouds bring frequent hailstorms and cloudbursts; the latter trigger numerous landslides, landslide dams and debris flow. Landslide dam outburst floods may sometimes cause extensive damage in downstream areas. Rainfall intensity exceeding 100mm/24 hours are frequent in many parts of Nepal. Annual mean temperature of Nepal is around 150 C. The winter season is the coldest, whereas the highest temperature occurs during the pre-monsoon period. Summer and late spring temperature maxima range from about 28° Celsius in the Hills to more than 40°C in the Terai. In winter, average maximum and minimum temperatures in the Terai range from a brisk 7°C to a mild 23°C. Much colder temperatures prevail at higher elevations. The Kathmandu Valley, at an average altitude of 1,310m, has a mild climate with temperature ranging generally from 19° to 27°C in summer and from 2° to 20°C in winter with occasional temperatures below freezing point in winter. Around 6,000 rivers and rivulets including permanent and seasonal rivers, streams, and creeks, from Nepal ultimately become major tributaries of the Ganges River in northern India. After plunging through deep gorges, these rivers deposit heavy sediments and debris on the plains, nurturing and renewing their alluvial soil fertility. Once they reach the Tarai Region, they often overflow their banks onto wide floodplains during the monsoon, shifting course periodically. The rivers are deeply-incised across the east-west structural grain of Nepal and the Himalaya, having eroded with the up-liftment of the mountains. Most of the major rivers in Nepal originate in the Himalayas with some having their origin in the Tibeaial plateau. Glaciers are the sources of the big rivers of Nepal. In general, the river systems have a northsouth direction of flows. The Koshi River, the Gandaki River and the Karnali River are the most prominent among the rivers in Nepal.  20  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  The priority risks due to climate risks and vulnerabilities in Nepal are: Quantity and quality of water, Food Security, Ecosystem health and Human health8. Government of Nepal emphasizes some adaptation progremms and policies in order to adapt climate change impacts: formulation of Renewable Energy Perspective Plan, National Adaptation of Action (NAPA), Local Adaptation Programme of Action (LAPA), Nepal Biodiversity Strategy, Climate change policy, Water and sanitation policy and strategy. Forest, Biodiversity and National protected area Nepal is divided into three ecological regions: High Mountains (35 % of total area), the Middle Mountains (42% of total area), and the Churiya and Terai (23 % of total area). The climatic condition of the country varies from alpine to subtropical conditions within a lateral span of less than 200 km. Within the same span, altitudinal variation is observed from about 60 meter in the South and 8848 m in the North. A study shows the change (given below) in forest area per 100 ha in region between 1994 and 20009. Region  Forest Area in 1994 (ha)  Forest Area in 2000 (ha)  Mountain  2.3  22.8  Hill  39.68  50.3  Terai  35.17  36.4  On an average, forest land has decreased at an annual rate of 1.7 %. The forest area in Nepal was last reported at 25.36% in 2010 (World Bank, 2011).10 Soil erosion and flooding are the major causes of land degradation in the country. Nepal ranks at 25th position in terms of biodiversity with 11 bio-climatic zones, 118 ecosystems and 35 natural forests11. Sixteen protected areas including national parks (9), conservation area (3), wildlife reserves (3), and a hunting reserve (1) and six buffer zones have been established for the protection of flora and fauna (Figure 4.1). The protected areas make up about 17% of the country's total area. Of these, the Sagarmatha National Park and the Royal Chitawan National Park have been included in the World Heritage List; and the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Bishajari Tal (Chitawan), Jagdishpur Jalasha Reservoir (Kapilbastu), and Ghodaghodi Tal (Kailali) have been designated as Ramsar sites in the country.  8  Nepal: Startegic Program for Climate Resilience, 2011.

Forest of Nepal, John Murry, London 9  21  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Figure 4.1: Protected Areas in Nepal (Adopted from Environment Assessment of Nepal: Emerging issues and Challenges)12 Agriculture area damage About 76 % the population depends on agriculture. Agriculture land increased from 24 % in 1986 to 28 % in 2000 at national level in the country. By region, agriculture land decreased from 33 % in 1986 to 28 % in 2000 in the Hill region which could be due to natural calamities. Agriculture land increased from 5% in 1986 to 10 % in 2000 in Mountain region and also increased from 42 % in 1986 to 56 % in 2000 in Tarai region which could be due to population growth and very limited opportunity in non-farm activities. The cultivated lands have been distributed into: 52% in Terai, 40 % in Hill and 8% in Mountain. With 65% of cultivated land in the slopes of hills and mountains where loss of fertile topsoils due to erosion is common. Loss of topsoil due to erosion, pollutants, improper use of pesticides and insecticides, and deforestation are leading factors of declining soil fertility in the country.  Solid Waste and health impacts Management of hazardous wastes is one of immense concerns in Nepal. Batteries, waste matter, electronic wastes are some of sources of hazardous wastes. Users and the concerned agencies usually collect the wastes. A proper disposal of collected wastes is generally very poor in the country. Lack of proper resources including means of recycling, infrastructures, equipment is a common problem faced by the concerned agencies in managing solid waste. Haphazard solid waste collection and not handled properly in recycling process and disposal system causes significant adverse impacts on public health 12  http://books.icimod.org/uploads/tmp/icimod-environment_assessment_of_nepal.pdf  22  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  and the environment, contamination of surface water, ground water and soils as well. In the absence of proper landfill sites, the collected waste is directly dumped in rivers or frest and agriculture areas. There are no separate arrangements for managing hazardous waste. Some efforts have been made to address hazardous waste management. For example, Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization Act, 1987 (being amended) describes that solid waste cannot be emitted, thrown, stored or disposed in any place other than place designated by the Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization Center. Likewise, a study had estimated the scrap battery to be 20-30 metric tons for the year 1998 and projected such battery scrap to 110-190 metric tons for 200813. In addition, Nepal has been a party of Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movement of Hazardous wastes and their disposal. Socio-economic Profile The Preliminary Results of National Population Census 2011 of the county estimates a total population of 26.7 million. Female population is estimated at 13.69 million while the male population stands at 12.92 million that is 48.56 percent males against 51.44 percent females. 1.8 million Population lives in mountain, 11.5 million in hills and 13.4 million in Tarai. The population increased by 14.99 percent in the past decade with an average annual growth rate of 1.40 percent. Multiethnic and multilingual country with as many as 102 ethnic groups and 92 languages is in the country. The country's current poverty level is 25.4 per cent, suggesting that it has been reduced by 5.5 percentage points since 2005.The 2008-2009 assessment of variation in poverty incidence geographically and socially remains much the same as 2005 reporting period. The 2009 assessment indicates that 95.5 per cent of poor people live in rural areas and the incidence of poverty in rural areas (28.5 per cent) is almost four times higher than that in urban areas (7.6 per cent). Furthermore poverty reduction rate in rural areas (18 per cent) is slower than that in urban areas (20 per cent). Remittances are one of the main contributors to poverty reduction. According to the Global Human Development Report 2009, Nepal has the lowest GDP per capita among all South Asian countries (UNDP 2009). It also ranks below most of her neighbors in the Human Development Index (HDI) ladder. The GDP per capita for Nepal in 2010 was about $ 130014. The slow pace of economic growth in Nepal is also reflected in its GDP growth rates over recent years. Human settlement is sparse in the Himalayan region due to harsh environmental conditions, the mountain regions is the traditionally populated zones of the country. The Terai region, due to its comparative advantage in transportation and agriculture resources, has led to the higher population growth than in other regions. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture as approximately 66 percent of the national population is engaged in agriculture. In terms of output, however, only 36 per cent of the nation’s GDP is accounted for by this sector.  13  DANIDA/COWI, 2003 Study on Environmentally benign Handling, disposal and recycling of used lead-acid batteries in Nepal 14 http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/nepal/nepal_economy.html  23  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  The land holding is a significant imbalance in land distribution according to the national survey in 2001/02. Only 5 % of the population hold 27 % of lands of size 3 ha or more. About 51 % of the population confined 59% of land of size 0.5-3 ha. Likewise, about 44 % of the people hold 14 % of land of size less or equal to 0.5 ha.  Gender Issues Net Primary Enrollment in schools has increased from 81 percent in 2002 to 94.5 percent in 2010. Gender and social parity have been achieved in primary education. The Gender Parity Index for secondary school net enrollment has also increased from 0.87 (2007) to 0.98 (2010). Quota-system brought in over 33 percent of women in the Constituent Assembly. However, women's low status in the control of resources and political decision making remains, as does high incidence of violence against women (including early marriage and sex selective abortions). The maternal mortality rate declined from 538 in 1996 to 380 per 100,000 live births, earning Nepal the MDG Millennium Award in 2010. The Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 79 in 1996 to 39 in 2010. At least one-third of deliveries are now in the presence of trained health workers. Full immunization coverage rose from 43 percent in 1996 to 87 percent in 2011. The mortality rate among children under five years has been halved during the past 10 years which could be due to well-coordinated scale up of highly effective child survival interventions, such as vitamin A distribution, immunization and pneumonia treatment. The largest challenge today is addressing mortality among newborns, now accounting for 54 percent of all deaths among under-five children. Gender disparities in political participation are decreasing both in elected and administrative government. Women now make up over 30 percent of the representatives in parliament. Implementation of an inclusion policy of women in the civil service shows positive trends. Although the legal age of marriage is 20 for both male and female, it is hardly implemented in Nepal. According to Muluki Ain marriage chapter, the legal age for marriage is 20 for both male and female 2010 or 18 where the marriage is solemnized with the consent of guardians. About 55 per cent women aged 25-49 were married by the age of 18 in 2011, according to Nepal Demographic Health Survey (NDHS). Likewise, 18 per cent of women aged 25-49 years in Nepal are married by the age of 15. Women in Nepal get married at a fairly young age — the median age of marriage for women aged 25-49 in 2011 was 17.5 years. Only 19 per cent of men in the same age group are married by 18 years of age and the median age at first marriage for men aged 25-49 is 21.6, four years later than women, NDHS reported. As per the survey, only two per cent of Nepali women aged 2549 years had given birth by the age of 15, while 23 per cent gave their first birth by the age of 18. Poverty Alleviation Programms The 10th Plan followed by the second three year Interim Plan (2010-12), the government has given priority to poverty alleviation. In this regards, some key programs such as Social mobilization and 24  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  empowerment, Income generation through micro-enterprise promotion, Community infrastructure, and Capacity building and human resources development have been emphasized to reduce poverty through Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) in Nepal15. PAF seeks to contribute directly to achieve the national objectives: to attain the level of poverty to 10 percent in 20 years in pursuant with the long term goal of Nepal Government; and to reduce poverty by half by the year 2015 as per the millennium development goals.  4.2 Environmental and Social Impacts of the Project The project would support a wide range of activities. Most of the activities which are based on the production of HMS services are unlikely to have environmental and social implications. However, there are possibilities of a few likelihood adverse environmental and social impacts due to particular activities like: installation of instruments for automatic weather system, Weather Radar System (WRS), by products of equipments system, and Capacity building trainings, etc. Potential subcomponents which could have some adverse environmental and social impacts are summarized below. Subcomponent-wise likelihood implications are listed in Annex 4.1. Adverse Impacts There are few subcomponents of the project causing likelihood adverse impacts on society and environment. Subcomponent 1: Technical Modernization of the Observing networks and Modernization of DHM communication and ICT system Environmental Impacts:  Vegetation removal: impacts due to forest clearance/ trees/plants removal if a station is located in a forest area . Land needs to be cleared up to 5m x 5m for Gauge House, 8m x 8 m for Cable House and 25m X 25m lands for Automated Weather Station in ideal condition. According to this, approximately the total lands to be required as: 0.45 ha lands (for hydrological stations), and 6 ha lands (for meteorological stations) in ideal condition. The existing stations are not defined clearly in terms of locations, lands. The precise scale of impact in each case will be assessed during the implementation of the subcomponents, and an appropriate mitigations, where necessary, will be implemented.  Hazardous and e-wastes: Dry-cell battery is the most commonly used power supply system to operate hydrological and meteorological sensor in automated operation mode. Such batteries are likely to affect human health and environment if they are not disposed properly16. The devices such as batteries, thermometer, barometer, electronics etc are sources of hazardous and e-wastes. They may be containing mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, acid, zinc, lithium, etc. Leaching of these chemicals into soil or water or into air affect the environment, wildlife and human health, or the staff/workers may come in direct contact with them. 15  http://www.pafnepal.org.np/uploads/document/file/Annual-Report-2009-2010.pdf Hostetler MA. Gastrointestinal disorders. In: Marx JA, ed. Rosen’s Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice. 7th ed. Philadelphia, Pa: Mosby Elsevier; 2009:chap 170 16  25  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards   Damage to agriculture: Limited damage to agriculture fields with regular mobility of office staff observers and gauge readers in and around the stations. The impacts may also extend to limited pollution of water sources (this impact may possible if office staff regularly moved to sites)  Denudation at the hill top: Since radar will be installed with construction work on the hill top which are usually covered by forest, the loss of trees and plants may extend to about 60-100 square meters. Social adverse Impacts:  Disturbances in agriculture lands: Although limited in extent impacts are expected on private and public lands, structures, standing crops and community infrastructures when AHS and AMS installed.  Employment loss: Likely to lose the job opportunities by a gauge reader observer if the location of a hydrological or a meteorological station is changed to a better location during the upgrading of a station. The changed location may not be suitable for continuation by the employed person.  Limited job opportunities to the weaker class: Less chances of job opportunities for unskilled worker, women and the member of marginalized communities as they have usually weaker awareness and poorer access to the development activities.  Gender imbalance: Women are likely to be discouraged by their families particularly in hydrometric work as the sites may be located in difficult conditions and that the work may become more challenging during high flood conditions.  Electrical and electronic pollution: Adverse impacts due to waste electrical, electronic (e-waste), and metallic equipment. Improper disposal of such wastes is the usual practice in Nepal, which may cause health hazards and pollution problems.  Radiation hazards: Although no significant adverse impacts on health have been reported during operation of WR17, WHO highlights that the Radio Frequencies between 300 MHz and 15 GHz may interact differently with human body18.  Education and awareness: During our field visits, people have expressed concerns about the possible long-term adverse effects of WRS on health including cancer, reproductive malfunction, and changes in behavior or development of children. Subcomponent 2: Enhancement of Hydro meteorological Forecasting System Environmental Impacts: Most of the environmental impacts described in the subcomponent 1 are valid for this component as well.  17 18  http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/washington_coast_doppler_radar/_Final_EA_Exec_Summary.pdf http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs226/en/index.html  26  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Additional factor is the extra consideration of environmental pollution that results from the added electrical, electronic goods, solar panels (life time 20-25 years) and battery recharging systems (life time 1.5 years). Social Impacts: Likelihood of adverse impacts due to waste electrical, electronic and metallic equipments, unavailability of facilities for processing such wastes may cause health hazards and pollution problems. Subcomponent 3: Introduction of Public Weather Service (DRM, agriculture, media, civil aviation, health, energy, water resources etc) Environmental Impacts: Dissemination of information will have no noticeable environmental consequences. It means, no any environmental adverse impacts of dissemination. Social Impacts:  False alarms: Dissemination of wrong information and false alarms by mistake or by poor estimations may cause unnecessary havoc among public and concerned agencies.  Misinterpretation: inadequate training and limited level of awareness may lead to the misinterpretation of the available information and warnings that may lead to wrong actions with more damages. Subcomponent 4: Developing an Agriculture Insurance Scheme Program and Raising climate resilient agriculture science, practices and applications of agriculture management information system Social Impacts:  Crop failure: failure of crop if the agrj-advisory is not implemented with right plans and procedures or the advisory is not properly disseminated or misunderstood because of poor trainings. Marginalized people could be more affected in such situation as the level of awareness is less compared to more advantaged groups.  System failure: In case of high dependence of the farmers on the advisory system, they may face setbacks in case of the failure of the system in delivering proper advisories in time or in case of the failure of telecommunication systems and networks.  Disagreement in mobile distribution: Distribution of mobile sets is limited that may cause disagreement among farmers. Beneficial Impacts Subcomponent 1: Technical Modernization of the Observing networks and Modernization of DHM communication and ICT system  27  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Social Impacts  Employment opportunities: Increased opportunities will be available for the locals to obtain additional employment as about five to ten labors will be engaged during construction phase of AWS and AHS for three days to a fortnight. According to the subcomponent of the project, about 175 stations (100 AMS and 75 AHS) will be installed during the project. It indicates that almost about 87,500 labor (man days) will be engaged for short term work.  Training opportunities: Locals may obtain training opportunities in the field of the operation of stations, equipment, automation, station maintenance, telecommunication systems, hydrology and meteorology,  Capacity building: Build the coping capacity of concerned individuals, communities and agencies by receiving reliable hydro-meteorological information and early warnings about the likely floods and other water-induced disasters. Such information provide them opportunities to get prepared for mitigation measures.  Improved adaptive measures: With the flows of appropriate information and trainings, people will be prepared for better measures for climate change and disasters. Improved productivity: Farmers would be benefited with better and more reliable information, which may lead to better productivity.  Improved assessments: reliable and timely availability of data and information can improved the understanding of science and impacts for the individuals and agencies concerned about the processes.  Additional support for marginalized people. Since the migration of women and marginalized groups are limited in relatively remote locations which are the preferred sites for hydrometeorological installations, these groups are likely to be more beneficiaries of the project activities. Beneficial Environmental Impacts:  Improved mitigation measures: Enhanced opportunities as a result of improved data quality and better dissemination system ar3e likely to assist in developing effective strategies for mitigating environmental degradations and for developing appropriate adaptation measures.  Promote scientific understandings: Availability of reliable data and information and improved access to such data will provide platform for scientific communities for research and developments leading to better scientific understanding of the environmental processes. Such developments are the keys to the success of environmental management. Subcomponent 2: Enhancement of Hydro meteorological Forecasting System and Installation of Modern computer processing and display system  Improved skills: Technical staff will have better skills for monitoring environment in more reliable manner. Increased awareness: increased level of awareness among different stakeholders will help to interact with the environment in a environment friendly approach.  Utilization of local resources: Application of available human and natural resources will be beneficial for upgrading the capacity of environmental management at local level.  28  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards   Favorable working environment: Technical staff will have more favorable working environment with better equipment and enhanced communication with the headquarters and regional or basin office.  Informed decision: Beneficial for the general public to know the information about the weather conditions and possible threats of the weather while managing their daily life with compatible and environmentally friendly approaches. Subcomponents: Developing an Agriculture Insurance Scheme Program and Raising climate resilient agriculture science, practices and applications of agriculture management information system  Improved lifestyle: Improved weather and climatic information may enhance the agriculture productivity and food security bringing changes in the lifestyle of the farmers leading to better awareness and education, which will ultimately help for environment friendly sustainable development  External support: Introduction of insurance schemes will bring insurance related agencies into the picture working with farmers jointly for better management skills for reducing risks, which will contribute to the management of environment as well. Technical knowhow: About 1300 farmers will get and mobile sets that assist them to develop their capacity to use agriculture information system by using mobile system Potential Impact on River Water The project will support technical modernization of existing hydrological stations for river flow measurement in Nepal’s river across the country. The type of activities includes improving the flow conditions around the flow measurement stations, river bank stabilization for protecting the hydrological station, and installing flow measuring equipments. Construction of new hydrological stations is not envisaged. The activities envisaged also include stable access to natural river flow at the point of water flow measurement, stabilization or reinforcement of few meters a river bank at some hydrological sites, construction of steeling wells on the river banks and other small scale improvements. These activities will be very limited in scale. During construction of the mentioned civil works river water turbidity around the sites may slightly increase. However, this effect is minor and localized which is unlikely to be noticeable beyond immediate constriction sites. There will be no water withdrawal. Hence, the project activities will not lead to any noticeable river flow disturbance or water quality deterioration beyond immediate site of hydrological station.  4.3 Institutional Capacity Assessment The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) under the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MoEST) is the principle institution responsible for providing hydrological and meteorological services in the country. At present, the department has four divisions such as 29  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Hydrological Division, Meteorological Division, Weather Forecasting Division, and Meteorological Network Division. Each of these divisions is supervised by a Joint Secretary-level staff. The department has a total strength of 233 staff. At regional level, the department has three basins offices in three major river basins (Koshi, Narayani, and Karnali) responsible for monitoring hydrological system. Likewise, for monitoring meteorological system, the department has three Meteorological Regional Offices: Eastern Climate Regional Office, Western Climate Regional Office, and Mid & Far Western Climate Regional Office. Human Resource capacity to seek out environmental and social concerns Snow, Glacier, Water Quality & Environment Section under Hydrological Division is responsible for monitoring snow, glacier, water quality, and environmental issues. A total of nine staff including six of officer classes are working for the section. Although the section has some capacity to monitor snow and water quality aspects, it has insufficient strength to address environmental issues related to this project. Although the department provides regular trainings on hydrological and meteorological monitoring system but it hardly provides trainings on environmental management. Likewise, the department has no human resources to address social issues. Key limitations in the department to address overall environmental and social issues are: limited resources (technical and finance), and lack of experts to address social issues. Technical experts from social and environmental specialist will be appointed in PMU as needed, for full time in the initial phase of implementation which may be made intermittent at later stage. PMU is responsible to address ESMF issues. Environmental and social issues can be addressed in the department by employing environmental and social scientists. Staff training on environmental issues must be included at different levels on regular basis. Currently, DHM has inadequate official networks at district level. As a result, coordination with the concerned stakeholders at community levels is insufficient to address social and environmental issues locally. Coordination and communication framework (see chapter five) will help to link with the stakeholders at local level. Once the department has adequate resources with a concrete plan, it can work with local governments to reduce environmental risks. Institutional relationship of MoAD is well established at central, district, and community and farmers levels. However, there is significant gap in resources including technical skill, communication means, etc particularly at local levels. Efforts are necessary to build capacity of Agriculture and Livestock Service Centers in managing environmental issues. Governance and Grievance As stated in the project description, potential adverse impacts of the project are not significant in general. There is less chance of dissatisfactions among the impacted population regarding the implementation of the project. During the field visits, people, in particular raised the issues related to possible opportunities and the added benefits at local level. Such concerns are likely to appear as  30  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  grievances during the project implementation phase. Satisfactory strategy should be developed beforehand to address such concerns while developing project implementation plan. The project should, hence, develop a mechanism that ensures to address such issues. Grievance redress mechanisms are institutions, instruments, methods and processes by which a resolution to a grievance is sought and provided19. The project will have a complaint system that allows stakeholders/affected people to raise issues or complaints through District Administration Office (DAO)/Chief District Officer (CDO) at district level. PMU will coordinate with CDO by to address the complaints. Where isolated vulnerable people are concerned, PMU/DHM will ensure to address their issues in culturally appropriate ways in close coordination with the relaxant group. External Relations and Partnership DHM has been developing public relations especially with the key stakeholders including government and non-government agencies. The media and public relations with the department depend on its services available to the partners. In addition to the partnership of the department, it has a very good understanding of the needs of partners. In this regards, the department needs to work on the partner's needs base. The department should have a coordination section and partnership policies to address social and environmental issues during the project implementation and post-project period. Sustainability Sustainability of the project depends on institutional and financial issues. Financial constraints are the limitations on improving institutional and project implementation/monitoring capacities. Likewise, political instability and uncertainties of the institutional policies are likely to have adverse impacts on the project. The project implementing agencies should have ability to develop a diversified funding base capable of sustaining its programmes over the long-term period. In addition to financial issues, the department should have a service delivery strategy to address sectoral areas: hydropower, DRR, tourism, agriculture, irrigation, drinking water, energy etc. The department can develop fundraising or cost recovery strategies providing its services to different sectors except in humanitarian response. Political Risk Since the government is in power transformation stage through federal system, many stakeholders except significant benefits (political and economic benefits) from the project. In this situation, both ministries (MOAD and MOEST) need to have institutional guideline to address stakeholders concerns and social issues in changing political environment.  4.4 Public and stakeholders Feedback As discussed in the methodology section, the stakeholders' consultations were carried out at central and district levels. The district level consultations were carried out in Lamjung, Bardiay and Ramechhap whereas central level consultation was held in Kathmandu. The objectives of the consultation were to: disclose the project objectives and discuss its possible social and environmental implication. In addition, the interactions were useful to discuss the project components with the beneficiary communities and seek their views and perceptions. Discussion about the project with the vulnerable groups present in the 19  http://www.adb.org/Document/SPF/Consolidated-Final-Report-05182009  31  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  communities. The discussion was also fruitful to review current procedures and mechanisms for voluntary land donation for station establishment. Primary stakeholders in the interaction programme included beneficiaries, farmers, disaster managers, DHM's hydromet data observers/recorders, women, DHM's Basin and Regional offices, staffs, key informants of District Disaster Relief Committee (DDRC) and Agriculture and Livestock Service Centers, etc. Likewise, secondary stakeholders included NGOs, CBOs, Media, Political Parties, community representatives, and other GoN's district and regional offices. The details about the outputs of public consultation are given in the proceeding report (Appendix of this report). The issues raised in the consultations are summarized below. Land Acquisition Currently, the observatory stations are sitting both in public (Government) and private lands. Land encroachment towards observatory station is a key issue when the land is not properly secured. The fencing around observatory station is not sufficient to ensure its security. Private lands for the observation stations are obtained from land owners on voluntary basis. Since insignificantly small area (mentioned in section 4.2) for the enhancement and upgrading of existing station, availability of voluntarily available private lands is likely to be a sensitive issue. Suggestion made available by the stakeholders included: a) The observatory station should be in government's owned lands by ensuring security of the station from human and natural risks; and b) Government should purchase private land to install/enhance hydrological and meteorological stations.  Vegetation, Biodiversity and Natural Habitats Observatory lands are required is small in sizes (less than 0.1 ha in idle condition). Notwithstanding likelihood of vegetation clearance to install AHS and AMS can be significant as the project activities involve several stations. Stakeholders advocating conservation issues highlighted that the installation of stations should avoid forest as much as possible. Special efforts are necessary for assessing the sites, locations, types of vegetations, sensitivity of natural habitats, flora and fauna. Human Health and Waste Management The stakeholders discussed on the possible health impacts due to the subcomponents of the project during implementation and operation. Although there were not many issues regarding the adverse impacts of automatic weather and hydrological systems, people were particularly concerned on the possible adverse impact of Radar System and its radiation field on health including cancer, reproductive malfunction, and changes in behavior or development of children.  32  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  It is important to distinguish between perceived and real danger that radar pose, as well as to understand the rationale behind existing international standards and protective measures. Safety analysis needs to be carried out during feasibility study of radar. Electronic wastes, battery used for power supply and other devices in operating automatic stations may cause problems in a long run if they are not scientifically managed. In this regards, management plan at project level with a proper mitigation measures need to be developed during the project implementation. Special attentions needs to be given in managing and dealing with the hazardous and e-wastes that might be generated from the batteries, thermometer, barometers, and other devices and may contain mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, acid etc. Project will give preference to devices that are non-hazardous or the least hazardous (such as mercury or lead free etc) if available. The project, early in the first year of implementation, will prepare and issue a hazardous waste and e-waste management protocol/guidelines/ procedure for use in the project. A general checklist and the formats for EMP are given in Annex 2.1 and Annex 5.1 as a reference. Income Generation Local people were particularly interested to know about the possibility of income generation from the project. Local human resources needed to be involved in the project during implementation of subcomponents and also during operation period to the possible extent. Likewise, the existing resource persons, such as observers and gauge readers, raised an issues about the security of their employment in the scenario of automation. The stakeholders suggested that both the manual and automatic systems should be operated for the consistency of data and information. Gender Inclusion and Participation of Vulnerable Groups Stakeholders raised the issues of the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in the project. Participation of vulnerable community need was one of the major highlighted issues during district consultations. Stakeholders highlighted the needs of changing the prevailing situation of minimum employment opportunities provided to women and vulnerable groups with higher domination of elite classes. 4. 5 Gender and social inclusion considerations related to project Based on the public discussion, field visit and social implication of the project, the issues about the social inclusions are listed as:       likely low level of involvement of women and socially vulnerable groups in project activities Low level of participation in decision-making Less access to benefits of project activities Less involvement of women in hydrological project activities due to challenging nature of work for women Discrimination in project related employment opportunities as stereotypical roles confine women to the household activities 33  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Possible roles for women and disadvantage (or vulnerable) groups in project activities;       Management of hydrological and meteorological stations Active role in protection of stations Role in information dissemination Organizing different meetings related to project activities Local governance  Knowledge gaps to gender and other differences     Low level of technical knowledge and awareness level among women and vulnerable groups Women’s limited access to education and skill and other trainings Women are less likely to involve in project activities due to their confine role in different household activities  Possible options to maximize benefits and minimize adverse effects     Encourage representation of women and other vulnerable groups in meetings Encourage participation in project activities Provide Priority to women and other vulnerable groups in different opportunities  34  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  5. Environmental and Social Management Frameworks (ESMF) 5.1 Salient Features It is essential that the potential environment and social concerns of the proposed project activities are thoroughly assessed in planning phase and design phases during which appropriate measures can be considered for the project implementation. ESMF has been developed as a decision making tool to ensure that the project activities selected and implemented under project are socially responsive and environmentally sound. This framework will serve as a tool to guide the project implementers to select the optimal project intervention required to address social and environmental concerns, prepare mitigation plan, and to ensure complete integration of social and environmental concerns and mitigation measure in the design of the project activities. ESMF recognizes the need for an early environmental and social assessment, during preplanning stage of activities at the field level to identify any adverse impact which helps to plan mitigation measures and help in mainstreaming this aspect throughout the implementation phase. ESMF has been prepared fully by considering the WB safeguard policy and GON regulatory/policy requirements. This framework includes environmental and social screening of the subcomponents; Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF); framework for vulnerable community development; consultation dissemination framework,; institutional arrangement and capacity building framework; and framework for monitoring and mitigation of adverse impacts.  5.2 Environmental management system The Environmental Management System (EMS) establishes the criteria to identify the level of processes involved in environmental assessment, their sequence to conduct the studies for various components/phases of BRCRH project including their legal requirements and implications. Once the need/justification of a subproject/activity is finalized, the process of EMS starts with environmental and social screening processes. 5.2.1 Environmental and social concerns The environmental and social impacts identified (given in Chapter four) at this stage are preliminary and generic in nature. It must be further elaborated with higher level of specificity ascertaining the scale of impacts during the implementation stages of subcomponents and activities. The potential impacts are identified during various stages of the activities depending on location, design, construction and operation as their potential nature, extent, duration and severity differs because of the difference in locations, nature of subcomponents and stages. Having categorized the stage-wise potential impacts specific to a subcomponent/subproject/activity, they are further elaborated in the appropriate stage of the project. 5.2.2 Environmental and Social Screening It will be ensured that the project design and implementation of the proposed subcomponents or activities are socially responsive and environmentally sound. While currently, project components and their sub components and individual activities are identified, precise identification of their 35  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  locations/areas will be finalized during project implementation. Most of the adverse social and environmental impacts of the BRCRH project are site specific. Environmental and social impacts of each subcomponent/subproject of the project will vary in their extent, magnitude and duration as per the nature and scale of the subcomponents and location chosen. 5.2.2.1 Screening criteria In general, the environmental and social screening process identifies what levels of environmental and social assessment are required for the subcomponents. The purpose of the screening is to get relevant concerns addressed at an early stage. It ensures proper designs with adequate considerations mitigate environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, it enhances opportunities for proper budgeting. The participation and consultation with beneficiaries/local communities and stakeholders are important in identifying the potential impacts of the interventions. The criteria (Table 5.1) are developed on the basis of the threshold values highlighted in safeguard policies of WB and environmental policies of GoN's; which are: (i) degree of impacts on the livelihood systems ( ii) loss of common property resources affecting their livelihood systems (iii) subcomponents affecting landlessness, shelter, unemployment, marginalization and food security (iv) activities that require relocation of households, acquisition of lands and other properties (v) subcomponents that promote or involve child labor and (vi) subcomponent that is likely to make adverse impact on indigenous people, women and vulnerable groups including Dalits (occupational groups), (iv) potential risks to natural habitats and forests, (v) pollution risks including land, water and air, (vi) human health and occupational safety, (vi) land slope stability, and (vii) built artifact or heritage . Each subcomponent of the project will go through environmental and social screening in order to identify relevant environmental and social concerns. The screenings are also helpful to suggest if any further investigation and assessment is necessary. Once the subcomponents are screened against all these criteria they will be categorized as indicated in the Table 5.1 and as per the nature and magnitude of impacts. An environmental checklist for screening is given in Annex 5.5. Category A is high risk activity, which are either not-allowed or discouraged as explained in Table 5.1. Subproject or activities in the following locations are ineligible for support under the project. Located in core protected area (national park, conservation area, wildlife reserve, Ramsar site, etc ), World heritage sites, and conflicted/ disputed territory.  Table5.1: Environmental and Social Screening Criteria Category  Screening Criteria  Category A  On environmental consideration, site involving physical activities in bio-diversity rich area, protected area buffer zone, migratory species route of movement or seasonal habitat, zone of high risks of landslide/erosion, high flood risk spots and  (if High)  36  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Category  Screening Criteria heritage sites are high risk. Similarly from social consideration, project sites included project activities resulting in loss of common property resources affecting livelihood system of local people; and major land acquisition and relocation of local people. An EIA is carried out for this type of activities as per GON EPA/ EPR 1997.  Category B (If medium)  Category C (If Low)  Subcomponent's activities don’t result in land acquisition or involuntary resettlement or both. If any intervention is required for the proposed reclamation /restoration, an assessment of impacts and preparation of mitigation plan. Limited environmental impact is possible. This will require carrying out an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) as per GON EPA/ EPR 1997. Subcomponents intervention which is likely to have no or minimal adverse environmental and social impacts. This will not require Environmental Assessment beyond environmental screening. Vulnerable section of the projects area, such as schedule castes, women, landless and other poor individuals and families should receive special consideration during project implementation. Environmental and social monitoring mechanisms have to be developed for this purpose.

PMU of the project will take responsibility for screening the subcomponents and preparing 37  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  the screening report. Project Screening Committee (PSC) will approve the screening report but MOEST is responsible to approve the report if EIA and IEE required for any activities. The screening process intends to:     Determine potential impacts of selected subcomponents as to whether they are likely to cause negative environmental and social impacts, identify the types and classify in terms of Categories; Determine appropriate mitigation measures for activities causing adverse impacts; Incorporate mitigation measures into project designs before implementation;  Screening Steps: Screening of Project subcomponents/Activities and Sites and assigning subcomponent Category           Identification of subcomponents/activities implementation site/location Check if the activity / location eligible – reject subproject/ activity if ineligible If eligible, identify physical environment of the sites: steep slopes (as per WMO requirements for installing AHS and AMS), degradation, susceptible or non-susceptible to frequent flooding/landslides, heritage sites; assess size of the project's activities: area, lengths of path to reach to site from the nearest motarable road, Identification of Major interventions with environmental and social concerns of implementing activities and their assessments Identification of relevant features of sties: settlement area, farmers status, cultural/religious observations in the sites, social characteristics (indigenous community, women, vulnerable groups, marginalized group, Identify potential risks and judge their significances Assign category (Category A or Category B or Category C)  5.2.3 Environmental Assessment and Monitoring There is no need for further assessment when activities/subcomponents fall in Category C, but it requires a simple environmental management plan including mitigation measures and monitoring system. Category A and category B subproject/ activity will have to be assessed for their potential adverse impacts and mitigation measures developed and an EIA or an IEE will have to be carried out. This will require field work. PMU will commission an EIA or IEE (a brief process for the assessment is given in Annex 5.1). Consultation and Dissemination. When the sites of subcomponent's activities with their possible environmental and social issues are exactly defined, stakeholder consultation will be carried out at policy and implementing level following transparency principles  38  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Follow-up-Environmental Monitoring Follow-up will be done to confirm the effectiveness and relevance of the implementation of the proposed mitigation measures. Monitoring will be carried out in accordance with the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) in specific activities such as installation of WRS. The EMP will be prepared for each subcomponent by PMU including the monitoring indicators for the subcomponents. Project will also carry out six-monthly environmental compliance review through project’s environmental specialist or independent consultant.

According to DHM, about 60 meteorological stations are in public (government) land and 40 stations in private lands. Likewise, hydrological gauging stations are in government land. The required lands are in the range of 25 m X 25 m in idle case and 10m X 8m in other case for upgrading the stations. Weather Radar System (WRS) may need about 100 m2 for installation. The lands for WRS will be purchased if it is feasible in private land.  40  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  The statements below is removed from wb but need to discuss The cost for the installation will be estimated during feasibility study. For the land acquisition, land acquisition policy and guideline need to be adopted if the department requires private land to install such types of instruments. The department will assess the details about identification of the location, types of lands (public/government and private) priority and determination of the size of lands to be acquired. In most cases land will be taken on lease as is in the existing cases. As per the World Bank policy, a resettlement policy framework has been developed in an attempt to minimize and / or mitigate potential adverse social impacts. The framework has defined groups of potentially affected people with varied eligibility groups such as Project Affected People (PAP), Project Affected Families (PAFs), Significantly Project Affected Families (SPAFs), Marginal Farmers (FMs), Displaced Families (DFs), squatters, encroachers, and other vulnerable groups. Based on the eligibility criteria and type of losses, the affected families or people will be provided compensation as well as resettlement and rehabilitation assistances. An entitlement policy matrix to this effect has been developed as safeguard measures to mitigate the losses by types of categories of affected people viz owners, tenants, encroachers, squatters' communities etc. 5.3.2 Policy Guiding Principles: According to the Bank policy on involuntary land acquisition, the guiding principles recognizes lost assets or income as fundamental right of all project affected persons and that physically displaced people must be relocated with basic amenities like school, health posts etc. Likewise all affected persons or entrepreneur or institution should be assisted to restore at least their pre -project income and livelihood status. Absence of legal title to land should not be a bar for compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation assistance. Vulnerable groups such as indigenous people, Dalits, women-headed households, and senior citizens should be entitled to special benefit packages in addition to compensation and resettlement. It is recommended to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement wherever feasible, exploring all potential alternative arrangements. 5.3.3 Resettlement Policy The guiding resettlement policies and strategies for the project (for specific project activities as per requirements) are as follows:      Wherever possible, the sub components will consider the sites that avoid land acquisition and minimize adverse social impacts. The resettlement plan should ensure that all PAPs should be able to maintain and if possible even improve their living. Develop a mechanism to protect indigenous peoples, socially depressed and economically vulnerable people like ethnic minorities, women-headed households, and marginal farmers. The affected people should be entitled for compensation for their lost assets. They should be paid a replacement cost as agreed between PAF and subproject authorities. In general, the compensation rate would be based on valuation of the district land acquisition committee and/or negotiations reached between the parties and witnessed by a third party. VDC officials or 41  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards             District Agriculture Office/DDC can be requested to assume the role of witness as a third party. Compensation for loss of perennial crops and trees should be calculated as annual net product value multiplied by number of years for new crop to start producing, Land acquisition process (see Annex 5.2) could be followed to ensure the replacement value for the land Ensure resettlement activities as a participatory process by informed participation and frequent consultation with the SPAP. Provide assistance to SPAF regardless of their ownership as title holders or non holders. Likewise, assist the displaced people to restore their livelihood and income generating activities. If possible, provide “land for land” particularly to the vulnerable groups. Similarly the relocation should be as close to the previous land/house as possible. The agreement should ensure that ownership of the compensated land and property is transferred to the community or the subprojects beneficiary. The Resettlement Plan Framework shall be implemented in consultation with and in participation of the affected people. Subproject structures will only start when full compensation to SPAP for their assets is paid. If affected land is under tenancy, both the landowners and tenants will be treated as affected people and will be eligible for entitlements and compensation. Rehabilitation measures for restoration of the livelihood of SPAPs will be devised under the subproject implementation plan. The effected people will get priority in employment during project construction works and other project activities. Project Resettlement Plan will be translated into Nepali and made available at the local level for reference. It can be accessed by anybody of the community as and when needed. A Subproject Implementation Plan (SIP) must include all the cost of resettlement and other social development activities. Likewise annual allocation, if required, is to be included in the yearly budget of the subproject. Functional mechanism will have to be established for seeking and resolving the objections of the affected people.  5.3.4 Eligibility Criteria The detailed eligibility criteria of affected people is given in Annex 5,3.The following groups of people, who have their own lands, are entitled to compensation and assistance under some of the subcomponent's activities (installation of AMS/AHS/WRS). Marginal Farmer: Farm families having less than 0.1 ha of land in hills and 0.25 ha in the Terai. Displaced family: Any tenure holder and his family members, tenant, Government lessee or owner of property, encroacher or squatter on government land who on account of involuntary acquisition or taking of the land or other property for the project purpose, has been displaced from such land or property. Squatters: People who have occupied land violating the laws and are not entitled to compensation for lost land under this policy. But, if displaced they are entitled to resettlement assistance as well as compensation for loss of other assets, such as buildings excluding land.  42  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Encroachers: People who have trespassed into public/private/community land to which they are not authorized. Vulnerable Groups: Distinct groups of socially distressed people who might suffer disproportionately from the effects of resettlement. These groups can be ethnic minority/ indigenous groups, women headed households, the poor (based on the poverty line), the disabled, elderly and landless/ families. 5.3.5 Entitlement Matrix The entitlement matrix describes entitlement of affected households for their loss of land and assets on land and the responsible organisation for the management of compensation scheme (Table 5.2). PMU/DHM will carry out land compensation works during implementation of the project by adopting the entitlement matrix. The costs for the compensation will be estimated by PMU in a close coordination with CDC during the implementation period. PMU will be responsible to proceed entitlement activities. Table 5.2 Compensation Entitlement Matrix Loss Category Loss of Trees and Crop  Land given on voluntary basis  Loss of agriculture land, if any  Loss of agriculture land, if any  Loss of House or other property  Entitlement Unit Landowner  Description of Entitlement  At least three months advance notice for crop harvest  In absence of advance notice, cash compensation based on annual value of the produce and calculated according to the Department of Agriculture norms (crop compensation)  Cash compensation based on annual value of the produce and calculated according to the Department of Forestry (for trees compensation)  Onetime payment as grant equivalent to one year Registered Owner of minimum agriculture wages  Employment as part time operator to one member of the household preferably to the woman of the house  Cash compensation at replacement cost Registered owner  Any transfer costs, registration fees or charges  Compensation for crops and trees if any  Subsistence allowance equivalent to one year of minimum agriculture wages  Compensation for crops and trees if any Non titleholder  Subsistence allowance equivalent to six months of minimum agriculture wages for loss of livelihood  Compensation at replacement cost or as settled Property owner (title by users’ organization and PAP or committee holder) under District Administration Office.  Shifting allowance of NPR 5000 as one time grant. 43  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Loss Category  Entitlement Unit  Loss of house or other Encroachers property squatters  Loss of Income source of income  or Eligible household  Description of Entitlement  Resettlement assistance of NPR 50000 /  Compensation for the structure build on government land at replacement value  One time grant of NPR 5000 as shifting allowance.  Resettlement assistance of NPR 50000  Subsistence allowance equivalent to one year of minimum agriculture wages  5.4 Framework for Vulnerable Community Development Plan Indigenous ethnic group (listed by GoN), women, disabled people, Dalits are groups in vulnerable community. In accordance with the World Bank’s Operational on Indigenous Peoples and relevant GoN policies a framework for Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP) has been prepared to define the policy and implementation framework. It addresses the impacts on vulnerable peoples ensuring meaningful consultations with these people during the implementation of the project activities. A common approach providing a minimal welfare safety net for vulnerable people in the project has been planned. Stakeholders’ consultations and social screening during the feasibility stage of each subcomponent will identify the presence of vulnerable groups in project's activity areas. 5.4.1 Steps for VCDP The steps to be followed for VCDP are as follows:          Screening to identify whether Indigenous / vulnerable Peoples are present or have collective attachment to, the project area Social assessment and analysis by social development professional in collaboration with PMU at DHM need to be carried out to address the social concerns of the subcomponent area Identifying views of the affected communities by following a process of free, prior, and informed consultation at each stage of the project, and particularly during project preparation Institutional arrangements (including capacity building wherever necessary) for screening project-supported activities, evaluating their effects on Indigenous Peoples, preparing IPPs (if required), and addressing grievances The preparation of Plan Monitoring and reporting including the establishment of mechanisms and benchmarks appropriate to the project and Disclosure of the draft Plan  5.4.2 Capacity Building  Provide an action plan to address the capacity enhancement needs of vulnerable groups including indigenous and Dalit community and ensure that they will be able to know real time information of climate related hazards and adopt mitigation measures.  DHM and District Agriculture Office (line agencies of MOAD) will be involved in mobilizing the indigenous people for group formation and strengthening through training. Likewise capable 44  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards          members of local ethnic groups, including women will be engaged by the concerned agencies of PMU/DHM to undertake information dissemination works, preparing the beneficiary groups for project activities and contributory works. Development of beneficiary groups during the subcomponent implementation will include social mobilization and information campaign, and skills upgrading. Representation of the vulnerable groups and their active involvement in project activities during and post implementation phases will increase their access to the services to be provided by the project. These groups will also have sufficient opportunities for gaining skills and getting other benefits of the project, such as income generation, developing capacity for disaster mitigation etc. Involvement of local media will uplift the advocacy organization at local level to promote project benefit on more sustainable manner. It will act as useful tool particularly in the field of DRR and the application of climate information in sectoral developments. Mitigation measures will prioritize while addressing the susceptibility of diverse vulnerable groups including ethnic groups. PMU will be actively involved in disseminating information on to the target groups beneficiaries about the key project components, subcomponents, activities, eligibility and selection criteria, stakeholder involvement, contribution of the project and project implementation process. Professional support will be provided to PMU through DHM, MoAD and NARC.  5.4.3 Specific Measures Specific measures for vulnerable groups including indigenous peoples, Dalits, minor ethnic communities, women, and powerless communities are outlined in Table 5.3.

Inclusion of the above elements in the contractors’ document.  5.6. Consultation and Dissemination Strategy Framework According to Environmental Protection Regulation 1997, consultations with the project's beneficiaries including local population and NGOs must be conducted ensuring their participation at all stages of project implementation. These consultations are important particularly when project activities start directly affecting these communities. Changes in natural and social environment must be made conditional to the prior consent of the affected communities. Representatives of local communities affected by the project and NGOs should be involved in consultations. Public consultations will be conducted during project implementation in compliance with Nepali laws on NGOs and Media and World Bank Policy on Disclosure of Information21. Consultation framework for information disclosure has been schematically presented in Figure 5.4.. The project's information such as sites, scale of impacts- adverse and beneficial social and environmental benefits, sustainability, monitoring system and the outcome of the project etc need to be compiled.  21  http://wwwl.worldbank.org/operations/disclosure  48  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Identifying parties having direct and indirect intersects in the project  Development of consultation methodology and identifying subject of discussion Consultation during project development Consultation with intrest parties Study of outcomes and consideration of necessasy changes in the draft version of the project  Provision of through information about the scope of planed works during environment assessment and management process.

Likewise, MOAD and its national level, regional level and district level organizations will also have some additional responsibilities to implement the Component D of the project. Furthermore, DHM will have additional responsibilities to implement the subcomponents of the project in environmental and social aspects at different stages of the project: Screening, Planning, Implementation and Monitoring.  50  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  5.7.1 Objective of the Plan The objective of the plan is to facilitate and support the strengthening of capacities of the project implementing agencies (DHM in particular) for the effective implementation of the project. 5.7.1.1 Organizational Level  Orientation on importance and needs of environmental and social screening and management of environment and social issues to the basin and regional staff of DHM and district/field-level staff of MOAD needs to be provided. This process will help PMU to coordinate with the stakeholders and to carry out screening of project subcomponents.  Environmental and social professional play a key role during the execution of the project. For long-term sustainability, DHM should recruit such professionals for permanent position. 5.7.1.2 Implementation Level  Organize regular trainings, seminars and conferences at different levels at DHM as well as at MOAD.  Provide orientation and training to the users at community levels on the management of social and environmental impacts. 5.7.2 Institutional arrangement for implementing ESMF The Project Management Unit (PMU) proposed at both the implementing agencies (DHM and MoAD) will coordinate the overall ESMF implementation plans in cooperation with technical teams of both organizations. PMU at DHM will work under the guidance of the Director General. Likewise PMU at MoAD will be supervised by Agribusiness promotion and Statistics Division. PMU should include at least one environment specialist and one social specialist capable of facilitating the whole project cycle related to ESMF (screening, planning, assessment, Implementation, and monitoring & compliance).  51  Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Detail  institutional  arrangement  is  shown  in  Figure  5.3  and  Annex  5.4.

Table 2.2 shows that some of the existing stations network (manned type) would be modernized to automatic system (automated type). In this regards, features of the modern systems including Automatic Weather System (AWS) and Automatic Hydrological System (AHS), Radar are briefly pointed out below. The equipments to be used in the modern system help to extract the possible implications of environment and social as well. Automatic Weather System: 1. Sensors and sensor interfaces:  7 Standard meteorological parameters that meets the requirement of WMO ( Air temperature, Relative humidity, Precipitation, Wind speed and direction, Global solar radiation, Atmospheric pressure)  Present Weather Sensors (present weather and Meteorological optical range)  Web camera to image the surrounding environmental conditions  Ceilometers for cloud height 2. Data collection unit 3. Central control and processing unit 4. Display unit 5. Communication interfaces 6. Power supplies Agrometeorology XXV  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards       7 Standard meteorological parameters that meet the requirement of WMO and ICAO ( Air temperature, Relative humidity, Precipitation, Wind speed and Direction, and Atmospheric pressure) Soil temperature sensors at 5, 10, 20/30, 50cm Air Temperature sensor (Air Temp sensor mostly the metal Resistance and semiconductor  based sensors)      Sunshine duration sensors Net radiometer sensor ( with four component separately) Soil moisture sensor Evaporation  AWOS for Aviation Meteorology        7 Standard meteorological parameters that meet the requirement of WMO and ICAO ( Air temperature, Relative humidity, Precipitation, Wind speed and Direction, Global Solar radiation and Atmospheric pressure) Runway visual range (RVR) sensor Present weather sensor (present weather and Meteorological optical range) Ceilometers for cloud height and type. Web camera to image the surrounding environment conditions  Relative Humidity Measuring Sensor Capacitive relative humidity sensors are commonly used and is based on the principle that dielectric constant change with change in humidity of the atmosphere. The other types are resistive humidity sensors. The choice of the sensors depends upon the environment at which the measurements are done. Wind speed and direction measuring sensor For the standard meteorological observation wind sensors should be placed in 10m height above the ground in open terrain. Open terrain is defined as an area where the distance between the anemometer and any obstruction is at least 10 times the height of the obstruction. Precipitation Measurement In automatic weather station especially for rainfall measurements tipping bucket rain gauge are used and it counts the no of tip for the rainfall measurements. For solid precipitation measurements weighing rain gauge are used with rim heating. Temperature measuring Sensor   should be housed in a Ventilated Radiation Shield  XXVI  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards      Should be at least 30 m from large paved areas and can be located in an open level area that’s at least 9 m in diameter. The open areas should be covered by short grass, or where grass does not grow, the natural earth. Need to avoid the followings:  Large industrial heat sources  Rooftops  Steep slopes  sheltered hollows  High vegetation  Shaded areas  Swamps  Areas where snow drifts occur  Low places holding standing water after rains  Standard Measuring Height: 1.25-2.0m  While selecting the representative sites for precipitation measurement care should be taken on following points:      The effects on the wind field of the immediate surroundings of the site can give rise to local excesses and deficiencies in precipitation. In general, objects should not be closer to the gauge than a distance of twice their height above the gauge orifice. Sites on a slope or the roof of a building should be avoided. The best sites are often found in clearings within forests or orchards, among trees, in scrub or shrub forests, or where other objects act as an effective wind-break for winds from all directions The surface surrounding the precipitation gauge can be covered with short grass, gravel or shingle, but hard, flat surfaces, such as concrete, should be avoided to prevent excessive insplashing  The features of the sites of AWOS: Sitting and exposures:    Outdoor instruments should be installed on a level piece of ground, preferably no smaller than 25 m x 25 m where there are many installations, but in cases where there are relatively few installations the area may be considerably smaller, for example, 10 m x 7 m (the enclosure). The ground should be covered with short grass or a surface representative of the locality, and surrounded by open fencing or palings to exclude unauthorized persons. Within the enclosure, a bare patch of ground of about 2 m x 2 m is reserved for observations of the state of the ground and of soil temperature at depths of equal to or less than 20 cm There should be no steeply sloping ground in the vicinity, and the site should not be in a hollow. If these conditions are not met, the observations may show peculiarities of entirely local significance;  XXVII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards           The site should be well away from trees, buildings, walls or other obstructions. The distance of any such obstacle (including fencing) from the rain gauge should not be less than twice the height of the object above the rim of the gauge, and preferably four times the height; The sunshine recorder, rain gauge and anemometer must be exposed according to their requirements, preferably on the same site as the other instruments; It should be noted that the enclosure may not be the best place from which to estimate the wind speed and direction; another observing point, more exposed to the wind, may be desirable; Very open sites which are satisfactory for most instruments are unsuitable for rain gauges. For such sites, the rainfall catch is reduced in conditions other than light winds and some degree of shelter is needed; If in the instrument enclosure surroundings, maybe at some distance, objects like trees or buildings obstruct the horizon significantly, alternative viewpoints should be selected for observations of sunshine or radiation;  Aviation meteorological stations      The aviation meteorological stations should be representative of the runway field for safety and comfort of the aviation operations. While keeping the instruments care should be given for placing the sensors to protect it from artificial effect due to aircraft. Wind mast which is at 10m height should be frangible type. There are number of sensors based on laser technology such as ceilometers, present weather sensors (visibility and present weather) snow depth sensors etc in meteorology but mostly they are classified as safe by WMO and other related organization.  Automatic Hydrological Station      Data Logger: Memory card, Processor, Sensor channels Power System: Solar Panel, Back up Battery Modem: GSM/GPRS or CDMA Sensors: Water Level Sensor  Weather Radar System (WRS) Weather RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) used by WMO members may be classified in several ways due to the criteria of the classification, e.g. receiving and transmitting type, operating frequency band, polarization type, type of transmitter, Doppler, non-Doppler, etc. The most common classification and types are described briefly in this part.The mostly used weather radars are C-Band , S-Band and XBand radars respectively. S-band radars Those radars operate on a wavelength of 8-15 cm and a frequency of 2-4 GHz. Because of the wavelength and frequency, S band radars are not easily attenuated. This makes them useful for near and XXVIII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  far range weather observation. It requires a large antenna dish and a large motor to power it. S-Band radars are generally used to detect and track severe weather phenomena in long ranges such as tornado, hurricane, etc. C-band radars Those radars operate on a wavelength of 4-8 cm and a frequency of 4-8 GHz. The signal is more easily attenuated, so this type of radar is best used for short range weather observation. Also, due to the small size of the radar, it can therefore be portable. The frequency allows C band radars to create a smaller beam width using a smaller dish. C band radars also do not require as much power as and S band radar. C-Band radars are very suitable for precipitation measurements. The new developments on polarimetry have made them very capable for hydrometeor classification. X-band radars Those radars operate on a wavelength of 2.5-4 cm and a frequency of 8-12 GHz. Because of the smaller wavelength, the X band radar is more sensitive and can detect smaller particles. These radars are used for studies on cloud development because they can detect the tiny water particles and also used to detect light precipitation. X band radars also attenuate very easily, so they are used for only very short range weather observation. Most of the terminal Doppler weather radars are chosen as X-Band radars by considering their structure and features. Furthermore, X-Band is very suitable for mobile radar applications.

Any development project, before implementation, should pass through environmental assessment, which may be either IEE or EIA depending upon the location, type and size of the projects. It requires the concerned organization/agency forward IEE or EIA Report to the concerned Ministry and the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MOEST) for approval. As per the provisions all EIA Reports are to be approved by MOEST and the information should be made available to public, and all IEE reports are to be approved by the concerned Ministry. The Act empowers the ministry for settling the standards and control of pollution. With the provision explained in the Act, the ministry shall issue provisional or permanent pollution control certificate to industries. It also empowers for setting complaints procedures for non-compliance of standards. It also facilitates to constitute Environment Protection Council to provide policy directives or suggestions to Government for protection of environment. National Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines, 1993: In order to integrate the environmental aspects in development Projects and programs, the government has developed the National EIA Guidelines (1993). The guidelines provide criteria for project screening and Environment Impact assessment (EIA). This includes scoping, preparation of terms of reference for EIA, methods of EIA report ,impact identification and prediction, impact mitigation measures, review of the draft EIA report, impact monitoring, evaluation of impact studies, impact auditing, community participation and schedules and annexes to IEE and EIA. Many of the guideline provisions are now included in the Environment Protection act, 1997 and Environment protection regulation, 1997. EIA in Nepal has now become legally mandatory. Environmental Guidelines for Small Rural Infrastructure Planning, 2057: The directive is focused on the practical implementation of small rural infrastructures through the minimization of environmental impacts. This directive includes the simple methods of environmental management in the different phases of the project cycle. More emphasis is given to prevent rather than cure. So, the recommendations for the mitigation measures are provided only when it is necessary. XXX  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Forest Act 1992 and Regulation 1995: The use of forestland for infrastructure Project is subject to forest law and regulation. The bridge Projects need to comply with the provisions of forest law when it requires the use of forestland for construction. The Act requires decision makers to take account of all forest values, including environmental services and biodiversity, not just the production of timber and other commodities. The Act, 1993 empowers the government in case of no alternatives, to provide parts of any types of forests for the implementation of a national priority plan with assurance that it does not adversely affect the environment significantly The act and rules call for carrying out EIA /IEE of the development proposals if they are to be implemented in the forest areas and/or passes through it. Section (68) of the Act empowers government to give consent to use any part or the any category of forest areas, in case of absence of alternative, for the implementation of the national priority proposal with the assurance that it does not pose any significant adverse effect in the environment. Similarly, the Act authorizes the government to provide part of national, protected, community or leasehold forest, which is absolutely necessary for implementation of national priority projects. It facilitates organizing users' group to manage forests. Section 49 of the Act prohibits reclaiming lands, setting fires, grazing, removing or damaging forest products, felling trees or plants, wildlife hunting and extracting boulders, sand and soil from the national forest without prior approval. Forest Regulation, 1995 Rule 65 of the Forest Regulation stipulates that in case the execution of any project having national priority in any forest area causes any loss or harm to any local individual or community the proponents of the project itself shall bear the amount of compensation to be paid. Similarly, the entire expenses required for the cutting and transporting the forest products in a forest area to be used by the approved project shall be borne by the proponents of the project. Aquatic Animal Protection Act, 1961 and First Amendment, 1998: This Act is one of the oldest acts in Nepal that recognizes the value of wetlands and aquatic animals. The act promulgated for protecting aquatic animals in natural water bodies like rivers, reservoirs and lakes has remained virtually defunct due to lack of related bylaws/regulations. Its first amendment in 1998 section 5a states for use of safe pesticides use for catching aquatic life. Section 4a, 4b and 5 empower the government to prohibit catching, killing and harming certain kind of aquatic animals in different scenario. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973 and Conservation Area Management Rule 1996: The act is the key legal instrument in protecting biodiversity within the protected areas. Section 5 of the Act prohibits, inter alia, hunting of animals or bird, building any house, hut or other structure, clearing or cultivating any part of the land, harvesting, and cutting, burning or damaging any tree, bush or other forest products, mining within National Parks and or Wildlife Reserves. Section 5(j) of the act also prohibits blocking, diverting any river or stream flowing though National Park or Reserve, or any other source of water, or using any harmful or explosive materials therein. Section 10 of the act provides protection status of 27 species of mammals, 9 species of birds and 3 species of reptiles. The Act recognizes six categories of protected areas, namely National Park, Conservation Area, Wildlife Reserve, Hunting Reserve, Strict Nature Reserve and Buffer Zones.      Buffer Zone Management Regulation, 1996: The Regulation prohibits the following activities with the Buffer Zone Occupy any land without legal ownership or cut trees, clear forests or cultivate forestland Any activities damaging forest resources or to set fire in the forests Excavate stone, earth, and sand or mine or remove any minerals, earth or other such materials  XXXI  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards      Use of any harmful poison or exclusive substances into the river, stream or source of water flowing in the buffer zone Hunting illegally and any acts damaging to wildlife Rule 18 of the regulations empowers the warden to give order to stop or rectify certain activities. This concerns operating activities or planned actions within or outside the buffer zone that have or will have a negative effect on land use, public health, natural environment or natural resource conservation. On recommendation of the user’s committee, the warden may, give an order to the concerned person or institution to stop such activities immediately or to mitigate the impacts.  Conservation Area Management Rule, 1996: The rule framed under the Nation Park and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1993 contain provisions for the mobilization of Conservation Area Management Committee (Rule 8) and the Local User Groups in natural resource management. It calls for the formulation and implementation of the management plans by detailing activities for natural resource management, wildlife conservation and their sustainable utilization (Rule 13). The rules prohibit activities such as wildlife hunting and damage to flora and fauna within the conservation area (Rule16). As per rule 17, the conservation officer may prohibit any activity, which changes the land use and affect the public health, natural environment and natural resources of conservation area. In addition, any person willing to perform commercial activity within the conservation area should obtain permission (Rule 21). Any person utilizing the resource against the rule is liable to pay the charges as determined by the committee (Rule 25). According to this rule, any activity that should be carried out should comply with the working plan. The Water Resources Act 1993: The act contains provisions to minimize environmental impacts, including soil erosion, floods and landslides. This provision calls for carrying out EIA study prior to project implementation (Section 20). The Act also empowers government to frame standards while utilizing water resources (Section 18) and to frame rules on environment related matters and controlling pollution (Section 24). Also, in a process for resolving any conflict, the Water Resources Utilization Investigation Committee should consider environmental impacts likely to occur from a proposal [Rule 28 (3)]. The Irrigation Rules, 1989, prohibits activities, which pollute the canal or irrigation water (Rule 4.1) Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization Act, 1987: This act categorizes harmful hazardous wastes and provides controlling measure. It makes provision to appoint inspection officer for checking and monitoring solid waste control and management with power to take action against the polluter or polluting agency. The Inspection Officer is empowered to issue directive to any industrial or commercial centre or individual to clean and throw away the wastes liable to harm the public health. The Inspection Officer coordinates with the local government to control pollution in land, water and air by managing commercial wastes. No direct discharge of effluents from the industries, hospitals and nursing homes is allowed. There is penalty of Rs.50 to 1,000 for violations. Natural Calamity Act, 1982: The act deals with relief operations and protection of lives and properties. Furthermore, rehabilitation of disaster victims, protection of life and property and preparation and adoption of preventive measures like Early Warning System (EWS) etc are addressed in this act. According to the act, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) is designated as the lead agency responsible  XXXII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  for implementation of the Natural Calamity Act, 1982 and is the responsible for rescue, relief works, data collection and dissemination of resources and information. The Nepal Environmental Policy and Action Plan (NEPAP), 1993 was the first comprehensive policy document on environment and development. Prior to this policy document the government had endorsed in 1992 the National Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines, which was published a year later in 1993. It was prepared in response to the growing global awareness about the importance of maintaining the balance between economic development and environmental conservation. Considering the NCS mandatory and constraint on policy and plan for the preparation of EIAs in Seventh Five Year Plan., first National EIA Guideline was endorsed in September 1992 and gazette in July 1993.NEPA provides with an outline of the main features of Nepal’s environmental policy. They are:        Manage natural and physical resources efficiently and sustainably; Balance development efforts and environmental conservation for sustainable fulfillment of the basic needs of the people; Safeguard national heritage; Mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of development projects and human actions; Integrate environment and development through appropriate institutions, adequate legislation and economic incentives, and sufficient public resources; Foster environmental education and awareness at all levels; and Facilitate participatory involvement of private sector, NGOs, international non-government organizations (INGOs), and civil society with government efforts in environmental protection  National Agriculture policy 2004: It gives special priority to development of pockets of high-value agricultural products. The local bodies will be delegated with the rights and responsibilities of formulation, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of agricultural plans. Farmers' group will be utilized to provide on-site extension services and resource centers will be developed and strengthened for producing local seeds, seedlings, plants and improved breeds. Such centers will be gradually integrated, and will be made capable of operating laboratory services in fields such as soil analysis, seed certification, crop protection and livestock diagnosis. Special facilities for target groups (oppressed, depressed classes, marginal farmers, and agricultural workers) will be developed by creating opportunities for gaining access to lands and contractual farm lands. The District Agricultural Development Committee and Agricultural Committee formed at district and village level will assist the local bodies in implementing and monitoring the policies. Safety Nets will be developed for those farmers who hold lands less than 0.5 hector and lack of year-round irrigation facilities and also for landless and marginalized communities when weather and disaster occurs. Information and Communication Policy, 2059: The policy highlights long-term policies on information and communication sector. The policy gives a high priority to develop the information and communications sector up to the rural level in a coordinative and competitive manner, while using proper modern technology and means of communications invented in the world at the moment.  XXXIII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Climate Change Policy GoN, 2001:The policy addresses climate adaption and disaster risk reduction by Monitoring the status of glaciers and glacier lakes through studies and implement adaptation activities in priority vulnerable glaciers; Forecasting water-induced disasters and risks created from climate change and providing early warning information, developing necessary mechanism for the implementation of preventive measures and ensuring regular supervision, and enhancing capacity; Identifying the people, communities and areas impacted by climate change and implementing adaptation and impact mitigation measures based on local knowledge, skills and technologies; Formulating and implementing integrated programmes taking into consideration the objectives and the provisions of the conventions related to climate change, desertification and biodiversity; Developing a necessary mechanism for forecasting and preventing vector-borne, infectious and communicable diseases induced by climate change; and Developing and expanding bilateral and multilateral cooperation for risk reduction and adaptation to address the effects of climate change in the international trans-boundary areas.  Himalayan National Parks Regulations, 1979: The regulations have made special provisions for the people living in the park enclaves to collect natural resources to fulfil daily necessities such as firewood, leaf litter, small pieces of timber and fodder. These regulations allow people to continue to graze their domestic cattle on the park rangeland. They can also help reduce the number of "outsiders" or even stop their entry into the park/reserve to harvest resources, and thus help reduce the exploitation pressure on the park/reserve. The Tourism Act, 1978: The act contains provisions to minimize waste and environmental pollution in the trekking areas. Scattered regulatory measures are also available in other sectorial laws but they do not clearly spell out the need for EIA studies. The Mines and Minerals Rules, 2000: It obliges the proponent to adopt environmental protection measures and ensure environmental conservation (Rule 19). Furthermore, the rules 32 and 33 elaborate provisions to minimize significant environmental impacts. This Rule provides an opportunity to identify potential environmental impacts and implement mitigation measures, which is a part of the EIA process. The Explosives Act, 2018: It is expected that explosives will be used during the construction of the Project. Hence, the provision of the Explosive Act, 2018 also needs to be taken into consideration. Section-3 of the Act states that GoN may declare any substance as explosives through a notification in the Nepal Gazette. Section 4 forbids producing, storing, using, carrying and importing explosives without a license. The Section also provides the person to apply for the license to the Chief District Officer with prescribed descriptions.

Land Acquisition Act, 2034 (1977), Land Acquisition Regulations, 2026 (1969) amended in 1992: This act and regulation empowers the government to acquire land for development purposes, by paying compensation to the landowner. The act clearly empowers the government to acquire necessary land at any place in any quantity by giving the compensation for the land required for any public purpose or for operation of any development project initiated by government institution (Section 3 and 4). Furthermore, government may decide to have the land acquired for any institution, in case such institution requests the Government for acquisition of land for any of the following purposes subject to payment of compensation and all other expenses under this Act:   Construction of residential quarters for the staff, workers or labourers of the institution, or undertake any function in the interest of the general public,  Project connected with an institution fully owned by the Government The term “public purposes” means functions undertaken in the interest of or for the benefit or use of the general public projects approved by the Government, and projects undertaken by Village Development Committees (VDCs), Municipalities and District Development Committees (DDCs). While determining the amount of compensation for land to be acquired for institutions other than VDCs, Municipalities, DDCs, and institutions fully owned by Government, the compensation fixation committee shall take the following matters into consideration:     The price of land at the time of the publication of the notice for land acquisition The value of the crop, houses, walls, sheds etc if any acquired along with the land The losses which the concerned person would suffer as a result of acquisition having been required to shift his residence or the place of his business by reason of the acquisition of his land. There is also provision to acquire land through negotiation; the government can acquire land for the purpose of public work by directly negotiating with the owner. The Government shall provide compensation to the concerned person and organization as decided by the Compensation Fixation Committee. The committee consists of Chief District Officer, Chief District Land Administration and Revenue Officer, Project Chief and the Representative of the DDC. The compensation paid under this Act will be in cash. However, under the Section 14 of the Act it is stated that, the Government may allot land to those people whose land has been acquired, from the land it possess such as Ailani, or Government-owned any other land, and if they prefer land for land.  XXXVI  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Land Acquisition Guidelines under the Land Acquisition Act2034 (1977) empowers government to acquire any land, on the payment of compensation, for public purposes and works. This policy is supplemented by guidelines and procedures for land acquisition. Land acquisition processes including required time are given in the report (Annex 3.3.). Two sets of guidelines related to land acquisition are significant for RAIP. They are the Land Acquisition Guidelines of 1989 and guidelines issued by HMGN pursuant to section 16 and 17 of the Land Acquisition Act 2034 in 1977. These guidelines specify two categories of affected families, Project Affected Families (PAF) and Seriously Project Affected Family (SPAF). A PAF consists of the members of a household including elderly dependents and minor children (under 18 years of age) residing under one roof and operating as a single economic unit, who are adversely affected by the project. SPAF is defined as a family who loses over 25% of its total land holdings or whose land is reduced to an uneconomic holding (less than 5.0 katha) or who is being displaced. Under these guidelines the concerned officials, with the assistance of the project team, are to carry out assessments of project affected families to identify their standard of living and types of assets. Valuation of land and asset lost were to be based on comparative market values of similar assets in the vicinity. The guidelines also included arrangements for rehabilitation of project affected families. For PAF’s, the compensation package includes cash for assets acquired or damaged by the project and a rehabilitation grant to cover any suffering and hardship. For SPAF’s, the compensation additionally include employment for one family member and provision of skill training. The Guidelines specify the establishment of an Acquisition and Rehabilitation Committee (also known as Compensation Fixation Committee, “CFC”) consisting of the concerned Chief District Officer (Chair), Land Revenue Officer, representative of the District Panchayat (now DDC) and the Project Manager and others as deemed necessary. The Committee is responsible for acquiring land and paying compensation. In 1993, a second set of guidelines reduced the Acquisition and Rehabilitation Committee to a four-member Compensation Fixation and Rehabilitation Management Committee by dropping the Land Revenue Officer and other appointees by GoN. The functions and powers of the committee were clarified as were methods of payment and means of ensuring fair valuation of land quality.  National Policy on Land acquisition, Compensation and Resettlement, 2006: The policy describes about the indigenous people, vulnerable groups, project affected persons, and seriously project affected persons/families in the context of compensation and resettlement. This policy recognizes compensation at replacement cost for the loss of land, assets or income of affected persons and their relocation. This policy outlines the resettlement principles. Guthi (Religious Trust Land) Corporation Act, 1976: According to the act, the land acquisition must comply with the provisions of the Guthi Corporation Act. Section 42 of this Act makes it clear that Religious Trust Land acquired for development purpose must be replaced with land instead of being compensated in cash.  XXXVII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  The Act for National Academy for Uplift of Adivasi / Janajati Act 2058 (2002) : This Act has defined “nationalities” (Aadivasi) and indigenous people (Janajati) as people having their own mother tongue, distinct traditional cultural identities and social structure. This definition apparently is very close to the World Bank definitions on the indigenous people. The Act has enlisted 59 such caste / ethnic groups prevailing in Nepal. Local Self Governance Act, 2055 (1999): This act provides more autonomy to District Development Committees, Municipalities and Village Development Committee. The Act empowers the VDCs, DDCs and Municipalities to conserve manage and use their natural resources and collect tax, revenue from the sale and use of such resources and use it for local development. Section 220 of the Act has provisions for revenue sharing with DDC, natural resources, including water resources. There are provisions relating to agriculture development; it authorizes the local bodies to plan and carry out agricultural development programme and arrange agricultural Haat (village market). It facilitates the development and operation of Veterinary Hospitals, and development of pastures for livestock grazing. The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007: The Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007) includes provisions that support gender equality and social inclusion. It has a separate article for women’s fundamental rights (Article 20) and is more inclusive toward Janajatis, Dalits, and Madhesis. As per article 20 of the the Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 “no woman shall be discriminated against in any way on the basis of gender” It sets forth the right to equality and to rights against untouchability, racial discrimination, and exploitation (e.g., forced labor). It also authorizes the State to implement measures for the “protection, empowerment and advancement of women, Dalits, indigenous nationalities, and Madhesis” (Article 13). Similarly, the 2007 amendment to the Civil Service Act reserves 45% of vacant posts for excluded groups, allocated as follows: women (33%), ethnic groups (27%), Madhesis (22%), Dalits (9%), differently abled (5%), and backward regions (4%) to increase the effectiveness and responsiveness of the civil service. Gender and Child Rights Mainstreaming Guidelines 2005: This guidelines was approved by the Cabinet of GON in 2061 (2005), aiming at enhancing gender equality and promoting the mainstreaming of gender and child rights, and welfare works in local level. Women Development Office (WDO) was appointed as Focal Point Agency and Women Development Officer is referred to the Chief of Focal Point Agency. Working areas of the Focal Point Agency are; a) Networking, b) Mainstreaming, c) Facilitation, d) Coordination, e) Contact Services, and f) Follow-up and Evaluation. Land Act, 2021(1964) and Rules, 2021(1964): The Land Act and Rules limit land holding of a person or family as landowner. As per the Act the maximum ceiling one can hold depends upon the location of land in ecological regions of the country-10 bigha (about 6ha), 25 ropanis (1.25ha) and 70 ropanis (3.5ha) in Terai, Kathmandu Valley and hills, respectively. It also puts a ceiling on tenants for holding land up to 4 bighas, 10 ropanis and 20 ropanis in Terai, Kathmandu Valley and hills, respectively. This Act exempts institutions such as government, local bodies, medical and educational, Guthi (Trust land) and foreign agencies enjoying diplomatic facility from ceiling of ownership of land. It allows land holding above the ceiling for industrial and agricultural purposes under certain condition and as prescribed by XXXVIII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  the government, and also allows cooperative societies to hold land above the ceiling as prescribed by the government. Furthermore, it authorizes the government to implement a programme for control of land fragmentation and consolidation of land. It provides appropriate facilities as required to a group of ten or more landowners who want to implement cooperative farming for increasing agricultural production. It provides procedures for consolidation of land and authorizes the government not to allow fragmentation below a certain unit of land in the area where the programme for control of fragmentation and consolidation of land has been started. The Act has made provisions to make facilities available for farmers wishing to adopt cooperative farming. Legal Aid Act 1998: The act seeks to improve access of the economically under-privileged and other disadvantaged groups like Dalit, women and other ethnic groups to justice system. Labour Act 1992: The act makes provision for a healthy, safe and secure environment for workers. It directs industries or any enterprise to arrange proper residence facility for workers. Enterprises have to set aside obligatorily 5% of gross profit for workers residence. Industries require waste management and the control of noise pollution in the working area. As per this Act, only Nepalese citizens can be employed on a permanent basis in any enterprise and the industries employing non-Nepalese specialists on a contract basis would need permission from the Labour department. Matters relating to workplace conditions including workplace standards, protections for working women and vulnerable people, and minimum wages are governed by this act and Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1999. According to Section 16 an employee or worker has to work 48 hours per week. He/She is allowed a break of 30 minutes in a day. Section 21 of the Labour Act authorizes the government to fix minimum wages of workers and employees upon recommendation of the Minimum Wages Fixation Committee consisting of equal number of representatives of workers or employees, owner of the enterprise and the Government. The Government, by publishing a notice in Nepal Gazette in August 2006, has fixed the minimum wages of different categories of workers. Working Conditions: Matters relating to workplace conditions including workplace standards, protections for working women and vulnerable people, and minimum wages are governed by Labour Act, 1991 and Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1999. Working hours: An employee or worker has to work 48 hours per week. He/She is allowed a break of 30 minutes in a day (Section 16, Labour Act (LA), 1999). Workplace conditions: The owner should provide a clean and tidy workplace to workers (Sec. 27, LA) and safety against fire (Sec. 30, LA). Minors (16 to 18 years of age) should not be engaged at work without adequate direction and training (Sec. 32A, LA). Housing: The owner should allocate not less than 5% of the gross profit to make provision for housing (Sec. 41, LA). Workers of the Tea Estate should be provided with housing facilities for workers who do not have a house close to the factory site (Sec. 45, LA). Protections for working women and vulnerable people  XXXIX  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Working hours: Minors (Between 16 to 18 years of age) and females may be engaged in work normally between 6 AM to 6 PM (Sec. 5, LA). Females may be deployed at work in a hotel and travel agency beyond the regular hours by making special arrangements for safety according to the nature of work (Sec. 48, LA). Minimum Wage: Section 21 of the Labour Act authorizes the government to fix minimum wages of workers and employees upon recommendation of the Minimum Wages Fixation Committee consisting of equal number of representatives of workers or employees, owner of the enterprise and the Government. Child Labour Section 2 of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1999 (CLA) defines child as someone who is below the age of 16 years. Section 3 of the CLA prohibits employment of a child below 16 years of age as worker. It prohibits employing a child in hazardous work. The Act includes services such as workshops, labs, slaughterhouses, cold storages as hazardous work. It also includes work such as manufacturing or production of pesticides and collection of solid wastes in the list of hazardous work. Production of biogas is also included in the list of hazardous work or enterprises. Prohibition and Regulation Act, 1999 : The act defines child as someone who is below the age of 16 years. Section 3 of the CLA prohibits employment of a child below 16 years of age as worker. It prohibits employing a child in hazardous work. The Act includes services such as workshops, labs, slaughterhouses, cold storages as hazardous work. It also includes work such as manufacturing or production of pesticides and collection of solid wastes in the list of hazardous work. Production of biogas is also included in the list of hazardous work or enterprises. First Five Year Plan (1956-1961): The plan was the first planned process of development in Nepal while Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-1985) had first mentioned the need for EIA for major infrastructure projects. Government had established a project entitled “Environmental Impact Study Project” (EISP) under the Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation in 1982. During 1982 to 1988, EISP prepared draft documents on environmental policy, environmental act and guidelines and conducted EIA on several ongoing infrastructure projects. However, the efforts at project level became ineffective, due to lack of interest of the decision-makers and the politicians (Bhattarai, 1999). Seventh Five Year Plan (1985-1990), first time a national level policy on environment management was incorporated. The policy emphasized to carry out EIA for all major development projects such as tourism, water resources, infrastructure, forestry and industry. However, implementation of EIA policy was not realized to the extent previewed. EIA was carried out in hydro-power development, irrigation and drinking water and road construction without mandatory requirement of the Government, though, but rather as a requirement stipulated by loan and donor agencies. The Nepal Government/National Planning Commission (NPC) and International Union for Conservation of Natures (IUCN) developed and endorsed the National Conservation Strategy (NCS) in this period for sustainable management of natural resources and the protection of the environment. The NCS for Nepal was prepared jointly as an interXL  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  sectoral umbrella policy at the national level for addressing environmental issues during the development process. Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-1995): The plan reemphasized the need for an EIA system to integrate environmental concerns into the development process. The Eight Five Year Plan anticipated the establishment of a national system for EIA and stipulated that EIA be conducted at the stage of feasibility study.  Ninth Five Year Plan (1998-2003) A participatory EIA system Poverty alleviation as the main objective Integration of economy and ecology Emphasized to make necessary procedures for the involvement of local bodies, communities, private sector, NGOs and government agencies Focused on the need for conducting EIA study in order to ensure biodiversity conservation while implementing development projects in remote area Institutional strengthening and legal provision Use of economic instruments Industry-specific discharge standards for water and air and appropriate compliance plan for industries Establishment of national environmental data bank and easy access to public Environmental programmes with the involvement of women and poverty-stricken people Resettlement Policy Status in Nepal: Nepal's history of resettlement policy started with the establishment of Rapti Development Board in 1956. Supported by US assistance, it was meant to resettle flood victims of 1955 in Chitwan Valley by bringing forest land under cultivation. In 1963, Nepal Resettlement Company was established under the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The company executed resettlement programs in the Tarai districts of Banke, Nawal Parasi and Jhapa. After five years of establishing Nepal Resettlement Company, a Resettlement Department was established within the same Ministry. The department mainly executed resettlement of displaced people on forest land designated for clearance with ten regional offices. For some time, both these agencies existed simultaneously and performed overlapping functions at times. The project specific policies for involuntary resettlement have resulted in disparities between Government funded projects and donorfinanced projects. These discrepancies have given rise to clear discrimination in the provision of  XLI  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  compensation packages and resettlement schemes among people affected by these projects. Likewise, the following are some of the areas and issues that the LAA 1977 overlooks: it has no provisions for granting compensation to project affected people lacking ownership of land; It does not address hardship caused from delays in payment of compensation for several years after the completion of the project; The LAA1977 lacks in mechanisms to ensure ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups—Adivasis/Janjati, Dalits and women—use compensation money in a manner that would enable them to restore their living standards at least to levels prior to the project; and It does not analyze the limitation of land for land compensation. Tenth Periodic Plan (2002-2007) : The plan seeks to reduce poverty from 38% to 30% by 2007 through emphasis on four key areas, high, sustainable, and broad based economic growth, social sector and rural infrastructure development; targeted program for the ultra-poor, vulnerable and deprived groups; and good governance. This plan includes genetic resources and biodiversity conservation programs in sustainable manner. Tenth Five Year Plan, 2003 Conservation of biodiversity through management of buffer zone involving local user groups, promote & encourage Eco-tourism in the protected areas. Conservation of biological diversity will be achieved through the utilization of landscape approach, community participation, and soil conservation in sustainable way forming basis for development, Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08 – 2009/10) Long term Vision: To achieve sustainable economic development by reducing environmental impacts Objectives: To carry out economic development by reducing pressure on the environment through implementation of international conventions and agreements Policies and working policies adopted in the three-year interim plan are as follows: Formulation and implementation of an integrated policy related to environment. Adoption of environmental standards and widening implementation of cleaner production, energy efficiency, environmental monitoring and auditing works Formulation, implementation and monitoring of the programs in accordance to the treaties, conventions and agreements on environment that are endorsed by and to which a Nepal is a party Implementation of programs as infrastructures development and socio-economic development works in which the aspects of environment are integrated and making implementation status public on a regular basis  XLII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  National Action Plan on Disaster Management, 1996 emphasizes all phase of the disaster risk management: preparedness, response, reconstruction & rehabilitation and mitigation to deal natural disasters. Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08 – 2009/10): Nepal’s Constitution does not permit discrimination on the basis of sex and advocates special legal provisions to protect and advance the interests of women. The Interim Constitution of 2007 includes women's rights, gender equality and the empowerment of women as important liabilities and responsibilities of the State in legal and moral terms. (“Three Year Interim Plan 2007/08-2009/10”, NPC, p. 102). In the Three Year Interim Plan, Chapter eight highlights the issues of women and socially disadvantaged groups (vulnerable groups) and describes the problems, challenges, objectives, strategies, approaches and programs to target following six social groups. I) Empowerment of Women and Gender Equality The objectives are to build and equitable and gender inclusive society by ensuring equal rights of women of all castes, creed and regions. To achieve these objectives, policy and legal reforms as well as other necessary measures will be taken to ensure at least 33 % representation of women in the policy and decision making process at all levels. Tasks will be undertaken to create strong environment, including legal framework to end all kinds of violence and gender discrimination against women. A special program will be run to protect the rights of conflict victims and internally displaced women, and to rehabilitate them. Active and meaningful participation of women in conflict resolution and peace building will be ensured. ii) Upliftment and Development of Dalits The objective is to increase the access of Dalits to the social and economic resources and thereby promote their representation and influence in proportion to the population. The strategies are to reform state structure, policies and rules to eliminate the constraints of Dalits upliftment. iii) Adibasi Janajati The objective is to promote economic and cultural development of Adibasi Janajatis by increasing their access to the administrative, social and economic resources. The strategies are to reform existing state structure, laws and policies which present hindrances to the promotion of interests of Adibasi Janajatis. iV) Madhesi Community Development The objective is to improve living standard of the Madhesi community by increasing their access to the administrative, social and economic resources in proportion to their population. The strategies are to revise state machinery, policies and rules to remove the hindrances of policy and structural nature to integrate Madhesi community in all state organs. Other backward class is also included in this group. V) Muslim Community  XLIII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  The objective is to increase access of Muslim community to social and economic resources and to increase their representation in proportion in the state organs. The strategy is to achieve proportionate representation of Muslim community in decision process and decision making mechanism. Vi) Persons with Disability The objective is to create persons with disability-friendly environment, free of obstacles and enabling them to access to all possible facilities for a just, dignified and independent livelihood. The strategies are to build legal, institutional, physical and economic infrastructure, to empower persons with disability economically, socially and politically.  Local Bodies Gender Budget Audit Guideline 2008: This guideline was approved by Ministry of Local Development in May, 2008, aiming at institutionalizing and promoting the system of equitable development gender mainstreaming in Local Bodies and its partner organization’s policy and programs. The specific objectives are: To institutionalize gender mainstreaming in annual and periodic plan of LBs To incorporate the gender inclusion goal in the structure and plan of action of LBs To monitor and evaluate the LBs resources mobilization, budget allocation and expenditure To contribute to Millennium Development Goals To institutionalize gender responsive good governance system The scope of work are ; a) disaggregated data, b) gender mainstreaming, c)gender responsive capacity building, d) ensuring program and budget, e) facilitation, f) Coordination, g) guidance, h) monitoring and evaluation, i) gender budget audit, j) gender analysis and self evaluation, k) good governance, l) exchange of experiences and learning , and m) documentation. Gender and disadvantaged groups related budget guidelines: National Planning Commissions (NPC) issues budget guidelines with close coordination with Ministry of Finance. Several guidelines and schemes have been put into effect regarding budgetary regulations. They include: i)Expanded Block Grant Guideline, DDC, 2065: It earmarks 30% of total DDC budget for projects to benefit women and disadvantaged groups. At least the Grant earmarks 15% of capital budget for programs for women, Dalits, Adibasi Janajati, the disabled, Madhesi, Muslims, backward caste groups, the elderly, children and youth. The challenge will be in ensuring that the implementation does not dilute its effectiveness. ii) Local Bodies Gender Budget Audit Guideline, 2064 issued by MLD and approved by GON and Ministry of Finance, guiding how to do gender audit. This guideline is comprehensive and covers many aspects of  XLIV  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  mainstreaming gender into the planning and program cycle of local bodies. However, it is limited to gender aspects alone and does not provide specific guidance on how to do Gender Mainstreaming and Social Inclusion (GM/SI) responsive budgeting from the holistic point of view. The Ministries and districts have yet to practice gender-responsive budgeting on an institutional basis. World Bank Safeguard Policies The World Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies concern of its support to sustainable poverty reduction. The objective of these polices is to examine the potential environmental risks and benefits associated with Bank investment lending operations. It is an essential tool for integrating environmental and social concerns into development policies, programs and projects by providing minimum requirements that all Bank-supported operations must meet. Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01): It is conducted to ensure that Bank-financed projects are environmentally sound and sustainable, and that decision-making is improved through appropriate analysis of actions and of their likely environmental impacts. EA evaluates a project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence; examines project alternatives; identifies ways of improving project selection, planning, design, and implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout project implementation. EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property); and trans-boundary and global environmental aspects. It also takes into account the variations in project and country conditions; the findings of country environmental studies; national environmental action plans; the country's overall policy framework, national legislation, and institutional capabilities related to the environment and social aspects; and obligations of the country, pertaining to project activities, under relevant international environmental treaties and agreements. The Bank does not finance project activities that would breach such country obligations, as identified during the EA. World Bank undertakes environmental screening of the project to determine the appropriate extent and type of Environmental Assessment (EA). Forestry (OP/BP 4.36): This policy aims to reduce deforestation, enhance the environmental contribution of rested areas, promote afforestation, reduce poverty and encourage economic development. The Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinion, would involve significant conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical natural habitats. This policy aims to reduce deforestation, enhance the environmental contribution of forested areas, promote afforestation, reduce poverty, and encourage economic development Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04 ): This policy affirms WB’s commitment to promote and support natural habitat conservation and improved land use, and the protection and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their functions in project financing. Natural habitats comprise many types of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems. They include areas lightly modified by human activities, but retaining XLV  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  their ecological functions and native species.. WB does not support projects that involve significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats. Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12):The key objectives of the World Bank's policy on involuntary land acquisition are to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement where feasible, exploring all viable alternative project designs; assist displaced persons in improving their former living standards, income earning capacity, and production level, or at least, in restoring them; encourage community participation in planning and implementing resettlement; and provide assistance to affected people regardless of the legality of land tenure. The policy provides guidelines for mitigating the adverse effects of development projects including social and environmental impacts such as land acquisition, relocation, loss of occupations and income sources, productive assets as well as community resources. The policy covers not only physical relocation, but any loss of land or other assets resulting in relocation or loss of shelter; loss of assets or access to assets; loss of income sources or means of livelihood whether or not the affected people must move to another location. When the policy is triggered, Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be prepared. An abbreviated plan may be developed when less than 200 people are affected by the project. In situations where all the precise impacts cannot be assessed during project preparation, provision is made for preparing a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The RAP/RPF must ensure that all the Bank’s policy provisions detailed in OP 4.12 are addressed particularly the payment of compensation for affected assets at their replacement cost. Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11):The key objective of this policy is to assist in preserving Physical Cultural Resources (PCR) and in avoiding their destruction or damage. PCR includes resources of archeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious (including graveyards and burial sites), aesthetic, or other cultural .Cultural resources are important as sources of valuable historical and scientific information, as assets for economic and social development, and as integral parts of a people's cultural identity and practices. The loss of such resources is irreversible, but fortunately, it is often avoidable. Indigenous People (OP/BP 4.10): The main objectives of the Indigenous People Policy are to: (i) ensure that indigenous people affected by World Bank funded projects have a voice in project design and implementation; (ii) ensure that adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples are avoided, minimized or mitigated; and (iii) ensure that benefits intended for indigenous peoples are culturally appropriate. This policy underscores the need for Borrowers and Bank staff to identify indigenous peoples, consult with them, ensure that they participate in, and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally appropriate way - and that adverse impacts on them are avoided, or where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. Pest Management (OP 4.09): Rural development and health sector projects have to avoid using harmful pesticides. A preferred solution is to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques and encourage their use in the whole of the sectors concerned. In appraising a project that will involve pest management, the Bank assesses the capacity of the country's regulatory framework and institutions to promote and support safe, effective, and environmentally sound pest management and uses various XLVI  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  means to assess pest management in the country and support integrated pest management (IPM) and the safe use of agricultural pesticides. Projects on International Waterway (OP 7.50): The objective of the policy is to ensure that the international aspects of a project on an international waterway are dealt with at the earliest possible opportunity and that riparian's are notified of the proposed project and its details. It may affect the relations between the World Bank and its borrowers, and between riparian states. Therefore, the Bank attaches great importance to the riparian making appropriate agreements or arrangements for the entire waterway, or parts thereof, and stands ready to assist in this regard. Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60): The objective of the policy is to ensure that other claimants to the disputed area have no objection to the project, or that the special circumstances of the case warrant the Bank’s support of the project notwithstanding any objection or lack of approval by the other claimants. Project may affect the relations between the Bank and its borrowers, and between the claimants to the disputed area. Therefore, the Bank will only finance projects in disputed areas when either there is no objection from the other claimant to the disputed area, or when the special circumstances of the case support Bank financing, notwithstanding the objection. Safety Dams (OP.4.37): The policy objective is to ensure quality and safety in the design and construction of new dams and the rehabilitation of existing dams, and in carrying out activities that may be affected by an existing dam. When the WB finance new dams, this policy requires that experienced and competent professionals design and supervise construction and that the borrower adopts and implements dam safety measures through the pr project cycle.

In this situation, likelihood of excluding in consultation with those persons while designing of future DHM system.  Capacity Building  ii) The local vulnerable communities (socially, economically disadvantaged groups) are hardly aware about the services of the department. In this condition, social implication due to lack of knowledge about the department's services. The voices of those communities about the DHM's services are hardly included in the new system of the department. i) Likelihood of less participation of field level staffs-Women, isolated persons in capacity building trainings. ii) Probability of less participation of powerless and marginalized people in on-the job-training iii) Vulnerable groups especially women are likely to be isolated from advanced computer training iii) Probability of brain drains  DHM Institutional development and networks i)Likelihood of unbalancing of roles and responsibilities of restructuring options women and men and controlling resources at field level ii) Due to a several limitations in the government administrative system, it may cause a less priority for the active consultations at all levels( from central to field level) and at concerned stakeholders as well. As a result, probability of weak chance of addressing gender equality (equal rights, opportunities, and responsibilities of women and men) in developing operational guidelines and strategic road map of the department. Development of a Legal and Regularity i) Likely exclusion of small and marginalized farmers through Framework for DHM operations (testing new private sectors involvement in sharing and operanilizing HM business models and enhancing the existing services. Public Private Scheme )  LII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Subcomponents  Major Environmental and Social Implications  Operational Support from Advanced NMS  i) Likely leaving out of local community and socially, & economically marginalized ethnicities to access on-the-job training  Implementing Training Activities for Major i) Possibly exclusion of vulnerable communities to involve in Users Agriculture, Water resources, Energy, capacity building activities to utilize weather and water related data and information.

Project management, Monitoring & Evaluation PMU is expected to include manager, procurement specialist, administrative support, technical manager, financial (managed by DHM) Program management specialist, and a social scientist. In this regards, likelihood of exclusion of gender equality (economic & social rights and participation & decision making) Technical Modernization of the Observing i) Automatic hydro gauging network consists of Digital Type Water level Recorder-Pressure Type/Bubbler Type/Radar type networks level, self contained power source system, solar panel, filled with Data Logger and it works pulse principle –a short microwave impulses through sensor system, and telemetry system. Impacts due to microwave on any natural and human systems would not be significant. However, some prequations like tolerable frequency range, radio wave detecting instruments etc need to be considered. E-wastes and backup power system (including batteries) may contain various types of hazardous substances including mercury, lead, sulfuric acid, nickel, cadmium etc. This poses a potential threat to human health and the environment when improperly disposed. These chemical may leach into the land and water, as well as to wildlife and human. ii) Gauge-house with its fencing for AHS requires about 60 sq m lands for automatic hydro-gauging station. Likewise, station of AWS requires about 25m X 25m lands (WMO Recommendation) in idle condition. The public land usually being used by individual or community or agencies and it LIII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Subcomponents  Major Environmental and Social Implications might be barren or forest coverage. Likelihood of impacts of lands-private and public. But the lands to be acquired for AWS/AHS would not cause resettlement.  iii) Mobile calibration facilities could not occupy lands for a long-time. So it does not show any adverse impacts.  iv) The radar dish or antenna transmits pulses of radio waves or microwaves-electromagnetic radiation which bounce off any object in their path to detect the range, speed, and other characteristics of remote objects (weather parameters). Microwave has not been shown finally that microwaves have significant adverse biological effects at low levels.  During the stakeholder consultation at district level, local people, leaders, planners, security forces etc are willing to guarantee that there are no any adverse impacts due to the microwaves emitted from Radar. Regarding the implication of Radar-a detailed technical survey with EIA needs to be carried out.  vi) Likelihood of adverse impacts due to waste electrical, electronic (e-waste), and metallic equipments. Informal processing of such wastes is in practice may cause health and pollution problems. So, a great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations. Modernization of DHM communication and ICT system  i) Chance of pollution due to e-waste and hazardous materials of solar panel, equipments used in telemetry system.. For example: Solar panels generally function for 20-25 years, so the majority of panels manufactured are still in use. However, in years to come, their disposal could become an  LIV  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Subcomponents  Major Environmental and Social Implications issue. So, DHM should ensure about recycling process of such wastes.  Hydro meteorological Forecasting System  i)Likelihood of air and land pollution around the department's premises due to dusts and wastes that would be produced when restructuring/reconstruction of DHM's buildings.  One-stop-shopping for Agriculture data program  i) Farmers with large land holdings may benefit more than others. Likelihood of exclusion of powerless and economically marginalized small farmers  Agriculture, weather and climate outlook advisory systems program  i)Chances of less participation in capacity building of vulnerable communities including ethnic minorities, Dalits, women, marginal and small holders farmers etc because these ethnic groups especially Dalit and small farmers usually have hardly access to resource center.  Developing an Agriculture Insurance Scheme Program  i)Likelihood of exclusion of small land holding farmers to access insurance system because they hardly could pay premium amount for crop insurance  Raising climate resilient agriculture science, practices and applications of agriculture management information system  i)Possibility of exclusion of getting information and knowledge by illiterate farmers.  Research and Development Program (on Drought and Flood resilient crops)  i) likelihood of exclusion of field level practitioners and marginalized farmers in research works because of several constraints like language, technical know-how, awareness, accessibility etc.  Capacity development, project management, monitoring & evaluation, and dissemination of lesson learnt and best practices program  Likelihood of less participation of women, powerless and marginalized people in different kinds of trainings  ii) Likelihood of less participation of women, powerless and marginalized people in different kinds of community empowerment activities on climate change and on information dissemination system  LV  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Annex 5.1: A brief process for EIA/IEE and some Templates The assessment process will constitute a systematic approach to the evaluation of a project in the context of the natural, regulatory and environment of the area in which development is proposed as illustrated in following Figure.  Figure 5.2: Environmental and Social Assessment Process  LVI  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  Quality Assurance Soon after the commencement of planning and design process, based on desk study, reconnaissance survey and experience of earlier projects, detailed methodology and schedule should be prepared for the effective and timely execution of the Environmental and Social Assessment. Scoping Scoping is required for screening. The next step in the Environmental and Social Assessment Process will be to define the proposed project activities and the natural, legal and environment of the area in which development will occur. This will be achieved through Scoping. Scoping will identifies which of the activities has a potential to interact with the environment. Scoping will be conducted early in the Environmental and Social Assessment Process so that a focus on the priority issues can be established for the rest of the Environmental and Social Assessment Process. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Based on the screening results, assembled legislative requirements, engineering, environmental and socio-economic data will be assessed in greater detail to ensure that all of the proposed activities and their consequences/likely impacts are considered in full. In order to identify any potential impact on and potential change to the natural and socioeconomic environments, the environmental and social baseline is necessary to be collected. For true effects prediction the following key questionnaire will be attempted to answer:      How will a particular project activity give rise to an impact? How likely is it that an impact will occur? What will be the consequence of each impact? What will be the spatial and temporal extent of each impact?  Environmental hazard and risk assessment Environmental Hazard and Risk Management EHRM is critical so that selection of any alternative is done taking care of all the components. EHRA workshops will be held to identify the potential environmental hazards associated with each proposed activity/alternative having participants comprise of key personnel’s from DHM, AMIS of DOA and World Bank team. Workshop will take input from all workshop participants in the identification of potential environmental hazards associated with the project activities and the evaluation of possible alternatives and options. Further, each will used to confirm the impact assessment team understands of the project design and as an opportunity to gather additional information on the project where necessary. All hazards identified will be addressed and mitigation measures will be proposed to counter any adverse impact. Environmental impacts identification Based on base line data collected along with engineering and social inputs, a comprehensive study will be taken to identify the possible impact on environmental attributes. The impacts will be defined in terms of their temporal and spatial implication. Once all project environmental and social aspects will be identified, the level of impact that may result from each of the activity-receptor interactions will be assessed. In assessing the level of impact that an activity may cause, two key elements are considered LVII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  namely consequence and likelihood. Prioritization of the projects should be done with respect to positive and negative environmental implications of the project and socio-economic benefits of each alternative and finally project having minimum adverse impacts with highest benefits should be selected. Mitigation and Monitoring Plan Mitigation is an integral part of impact evaluation. It looks for better ways of doing things so that the negative impacts of the proposal are eliminated or minimized and the benefits are enhanced. As soon as significant adverse impacts are identified, discussions should be held to see if they can be ‘designed out’ through changes in project design, location or operation. Identified severe in consequence category and or likelihood category will be further analyzed to identify additional mitigation measures that are potentially available to eliminate or reduce the predicted level of impact. Where mitigation is deemed appropriate, a proponent should strive to act upon effects, in the following order of priority, to:      Eliminate or avoid adverse effects, where reasonably achievable. Reduce adverse effects to the lowest reasonably achievable level. Regulate adverse effects to an acceptable level, or to an acceptable time period. Create other beneficial effects to partially or fully substitute for, or counter-balance, adverse effects.  Environmental Management Plan EMP consists of the set of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures to be taken during implementation and operation to eliminate adverse environmental and social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable levels. The EMP identifies feasible and cost-effective measures that may reduce potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels. The plan includes compensatory measures if mitigation measures are not feasible, cost-effective, or sufficient.The EMP should be developed so as to counter the impacts assessed during screening process and also the likely impacts during the construction and operational phase. For the case of High and Moderate impact level plan will be developed in EIA and IEE. The subprojects that are not under the IEE or EIA threshold but if their implementation could have adverse environmental and social impacts; they fall under Low or negligible category. The environmental social management of subprojects and their selection criteria will ensure that any selected subproject does not adversely affect people particularly the vulnerable and poor and their environment. Meanwhile it may be difficult to assign a value to measure the social harm done by a subproject. In such situation one may have to use his cautious judgment to weigh up the magnitude of damage or loss instead of banking on entirely on the prescribed criteria. In this scenario Project management unit will prepare a general plan following the Environmental Standards, and fill  Potential Impact of Project Activities as presented in Annex 5.2 . Project Management Unit (PMU)  LVIII  Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards  will also fill Project Impacts and recommended Mitigation Measures as presented in the Annex 5.3 to know about the mitigation cost. Department of Hydrology and Meteorology will be the executing Agency executing agency of the BRCRH. On a day to day basis, implementation will be coordinated by a PMU of DHM.

Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The rapid urban population growth, coupled with the Government?s inability to keep pace with the demand for infrastructure and services has led to a series of urban environmental concerns in the secondary towns and constraining the economic growth of Nepal. Urban sector economy plays a key role for providing services and employment opportunities to the rural hinterland. Nepal?s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) (2005-2009) promotes investments to meet the urgent need for safe water supply and sanitation services in urban areas observing rapid urbanization, aiming to foster inclusive social development. Nepal is ranked 142nd out of 177 countries in terms of human development index shown in the Human Development Report 2007/2008, which clearly warrants further needs of social development. Although proportion of population with access to clean drinking water is reported at rather high 76.6% in 2006 by the Government, figures substantially vary depending on the source, and water supply is still considered insufficient in both volume and quality even in Kathmandu, the capital. Situation for sanitation and solid waste management is even worse, thus necessitating urgent intervention in these sub-sectors. Investments in these sub-sectors in selected secondary towns, catching up with the rapid and haphazard urbanization, are essential for providing clean and developed urban environment in line with the National Urban Policy (NUP) 2007. Moreover, the CSP and NUP address the need to strengthen rural-urban connectivity for promoting broad-based economic growth. Therefore, other urban infrastructure, such as improvement of road network, bus terminals and markets, would play an important role in enhancing rural-urban links. These approaches are still valid and confirmed in Nepal Country Operations Business Plan (2008-2010) and the latest Country Programming Mission conducted in April 2008, though the political and security context in Nepal has changed since the preparation of the CSP. The proposed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and ensuing Project intends to support the Government for an inclusive social development and broad-based economic growth through provision of environmental and other urban infrastructure in selected secondary towns by taking an integrated approach. The Project will build on the lessons learned under the on-going Urban and Environmental Improvement Project (Loan 1966-NEP), in particular in terms of implementation framework and financial arrangement. **** Impact **** Improved quality of life and higher economic growth in selected secondary towns in Nepal. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Project design and feasibility study that the borrower and ADB have agreed upon. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs The PPTA plans to deliver the following two main outputs: (i) preparation of feasibility study; and (ii) formulation of appropriate institutional and implementation framework. The first component will strategically select three to five target secondary towns with high economic growth potential and urgent needs for urban environmental improvement and supplementary urban facilities in line with the relevant development policy and strategy, after carefully examining commitment, capacity and readiness of candidate secondary towns. Then, the work is carried out to identify sub-projects and prepare overall investment package, including safeguard reports. The investment package will cover provision of infrastructure for urban environmental improvement mainly for household services such as water supply, sanitation (wastewater treatment), drainage and solid waste management, and supplementary urban facilities such as urban road, bus terminals, city parks and markets, and may include seed money for land pooling. Moreover, economic activities such as cold storage facilities may be considered under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Social and poverty assessment will be undertaken and mechanisms for improving access to and quality of basic urban services for the poor will be assessed. The second component will include institutional assessment of central as well as local bodies, from technical, financial and managerial viewpoints. On the basis of review of current status and direction of decentralization/devolution, appropriate institutional and financial arrangements will be proposed, together with comprehensive capacity building programs. These two components will be implemented in tandem in a closely coordinated manner. The PPTA will be implemented over a period of 8 months in two phases. The first phase of the PPTA will be executed in 3 months, when three to five target secondary towns will be determined. The second phase will be implemented over a period of 5 months for preparation of overall investment package and formulation of institutional and implementation framework. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: Indigenous Peoples: **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** The PPTA will undertake socioeconomic surveys, and prepare resettlement plans and environmental assessment reports such as initial environmental examination (IEE) for subprojects, as needed. Though subprojects are not expected to impose significant adverse environmental and social impacts, safeguard plans will be carefully developed in order to obtain public acceptance and thus not cause potential delay in implementation. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Discussions will be held with officials of relevant government ministries and departments, and development partners including NGOs actively engaged in urban environmental improvement.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 04 Jul 2008     * Fact-finding: 09 Jul 2008 to 16 Jul 2008     * Approval: 02 Dec 2008     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** ADB's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nepal (2005 ? 2009) rests on three pillars of which fostering inclusive social development is one. The three sub- sectors prioritized under this pillar are (i) education, (ii) water supply, sanitation and urban development, and (iii) social protection. While the strategy emphasizes on building social protection initiatives within the project design, it also identified the need to build capacity in social protection institutions in Nepal. The CPS is in line with ADB's Strategy 2020, which places emphasis on promoting greater access to opportunities by expanding human capacities through investments in education, health and basic social protections; as well as with the government's development strategy which has been increasingly expressing its deep commitment to social justice and equity and is striving to expand its safety net and social protection coverage. Nepal has had in place an old-age pension scheme and benefits to widows and the disabled since 1994. Since the current fiscal year, the government has expanded this coverage by lowering the age limit and expanding its cash-transfer scheme to certain caste/ethnic groups. The allowance has also been increased. However, there are no child centered cash-transfer schemes at the moment despite strong evidence that child protection measures can have significant impacts on the health of children and their consequent contribution to society. Many studies on early child brain development, including a study done by ADB shows that child development is at the core of human development theory and that the most critical period of brain development is in the first three years of life, proper nutrition being a critical factor in healthy brain development. It is estimated that more than half of Nepal's under-five children are stunted for their age, and despite significant decrease in infant mortality rates, over 40,000 under-one children are still dying in Nepal every year. A study conducted in 1999 revealed that of the 95,000 under-five child deaths in Nepal every year, about 54% were attributed to moderate and severe malnutrition, with the "moderates" responsible for most of the deaths. It has been proven that mental stunting resulting from malnutrition is irreversible and the World Bank estimated in 2007 that malnutrition in children in Nepal causes a GDP loss of around 3% per year. Thus, studies have shown that the highest human capital rates of return can be achieved from social protection targeting pre-school children. Confounding to these problems is a recent food alert by the World Food Programme in Nepal, warning of an impending food shortage, particularly in the mid- and far-western hills of Nepal due to low winter precipitation. Undoubtedly, children would be impacted the most. In 2008 UNICEF and WFP conducted an exploratory survey to see how child benefit cash transfers would be used by households. The study revealed that more than 40% of the money from cash transfers to mothers would be spent on supplementary food for children, around 30% on children's education and 11% or more on health care. Evidence from another ADB project also demonstrated that women who were provided cash transfers did have control over the money, and most of the allowance provided to cover "basic needs" was spent on food, house maintenance, medicine, education, clothing and household supplies, in that order of priority. Thus, the justification to provide a monthly cash allowance and its direct relevance to poverty reduction is more than evident for this project. **** Impact **** Reduction in child malnutrition in the project districts **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Enhanced execution of social protection programs **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs Enhanced capacity of local bodies in the project districts to deliver the child grant Enhanced capacity of the government to design efficient and evidence- based social protection programs Enhanced networking between local bodies, health facilities, and communities in the project districts for improving child nutrition Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Output: Enhanced capacity of local bodies in the project districts to deliver the child grant - Social protection Officers (SPOs) mobilized at the districts since December 2012. However, currently, there is only one SPO remaining. The EA is in the process of filling the vacancies. - In case of social protection volunteers (SPVs), although the contract was signed on 23 January 2014, failure of the recruited firm to perform well has led to the cancellation of the contract. The EA is in the process of formalizing the cancellation. - Management Information Specialists (MIS) contract signed on 23 January 2014. Output 2: Enhanced capacity of the government to design efficient and evidence- based social protection programs - A 2-day orientation and sharing workshop was conducted for local development officers and SPOs from five project districts and governance officers from UNICEF's mid- and far- western regional office. A 7-day capacity building training on social protection is also undertaken. - On finalization of National Social Protection Framework, the consulting firm has submitted the draft report. Comments on the draft report provided. - Manual on cash transfer completed (child grant operations manual consolidated into one comprehensive social protection operations manual) Output Enhanced networking between local bodies, health facilities, and communities in the project districts for improving child nutrition: - 1,169 FCHVs and 436 health facility staff trained. - Midline survey completed. Preliminary results are showing positive impacts of the child grant in the five project districts. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: C Involuntary Resettlement: C Indigenous Peoples: B **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect No adverse environmental impacts are anticipated as a result of project implementation. Involuntary Resettlement The project will not cause any involuntary resettlement. Indigenous Peoples The project will pay special attention to ensuring that the delivery systems will reach the indigenous and excluded groups. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design A fact finding mission was fielded intermittently from 21 October 2009 to 18 April 2010. The mission undertook a field visit to one of the Karnali districts (Dolpa) from 23 October 2009 to 5 November 2009 to assess the ground realities of implementing cash grants in the remote mountain districts of Nepal. A workshop was organized in Kathmandu on 11 December 2009 to debrief central government officials on the mission s field visit and to brainstorm on the ideas that had been proposed by the DDC staff and local villagers in Dolpa. Consultations were also held with development partners. During Project Implementation A midterm review of the project was undertaken during 1 - 5 April 2013 which held consultation with the relevant stakeholders. A review mission - following the extension of the physical completion date of the project from 8 June 2014 to 15 July 2015 - was undertaken during 7 - 19 July 2014. The mission held consultations with the relevant stakeholders.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 12 Aug 2008     * Fact-finding: 24 Oct 2009 to 18 Apr 2010     * Approval: 28 Feb 2011     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

  * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The TA objective is to enhance both institutional and human resource capacity of key government agencies in developing and using macroeconomic models and improve the national statistical system. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Institutional capacity for economic policy analysis in Nepal is weak and as a result, public policy formulation is often not based on a sound analytical foundation. The need for sound economic policy analysis has become even more critical over the years in view of the stagnating economic growth and for better understanding the evolving structure of Nepal?s economy, its increasing complexity and the interactions between different economic sectors. Economic policy analysis has also been constrained by Nepal?s weak national statistical system, particularly the lack of quality and timely macroeconomic data. Given the importance of reliable and timely macroeconomic data for policy analysis, ADB has also been assisting the Government in strengthening Nepal?s weak statistical system. Recent assistance in this respect includes: (i) TA 3451-NEP (completed in 2004): Strengthening the National Statistical System, which helped in developing a consolidated national statistical plan (CNSP), and improving compilation of the NA, agriculture statistics development and poverty monitoring, and (ii) TA 4460-NEP: Strengthening the National Accounts System (near completion), which supported migration of the national accounts to the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993, benchmarking and rebasing the national accounts estimates, and development of a system of compiling quarterly national accounts. Also, a diagnostic study was conducted on Nepal?s statistical system under RETA 6333: Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia Pacific Region, which recommended adoption of the CNSP without further delay and identified a broad range of long-term statistical capacity building (SCB) needs of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS, the main statistical agency) and other Government agencies. **** Impact **** Economic policies based on an improved statistical system (national accounts) and sound quantitative macroeconomic analysis. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Component A: (i) A more conducive legal and institutional environment for improving the national statistical system. (ii) A system of QNAcompilation established. Component B: Macroeconomic tools developed for short- to medium- term macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis. Progress Towards Outcome While the legal and institutional reforms are still underway, the system of compiling QNA data has been streamlined. NMEM is institutionalized and the DSGE model finalized. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs Component A: Enactment of the new Statistical Act, more autonomous CBS, and more functional National Statistical Council (NSC) Component A: Quarterly GDP estimates for FY2007 FY2010 Component B: Upgrade of the Nepal Macroeconomic Model (NMEM) Compoent B: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)-type model developed for Nepal Component B: User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress - Draft Statiscal Act being submitted to the Cabinet. - Quarterly GDP estimates for all sectors completed. - User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting prepared. - DSGE model finalized and submitted to NRB. - Upgradation of the NMEM completed. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design The project was included in the country program on the request of the Government (mainly Central Bureau of Statistics and Nepal Rastra Bank). The TA was prepared in full consultation with the Government agencies. During Project Implementation Ongoing.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.

This is expected to contribute to a reduction of the rural-urban poverty gap and increased food security for the poor, as a result of improved social protection measures taken by the Government of Nepal. The S-CDTA project design also takes into account two of the five drivers of change identified in the ADB Strategy 2020: (i) good governance and capacity development, by focusing on capacity building of central and local governments to plan and implement social policies more effectively; and (ii) knowledge solutions, by bringing in knowledge of international best practices in the field of social protection. **** Impact **** Government's social protection objectives met. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Strengthened capacity of government to manage social protection schemes.

Introduction  1.From November 17 to 25, 2011, a joint World Bank and United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) team visited Nepal to undertake implementation support consultations for a review of the Human Development Social Protection pilot project (HDSPP)'. The objectives of the consultations were to (i) review the status of project implementation and discuss any implementation challenges towards achieving project objectives; (ii) review the composition and capacity of the project team and the project's readiness with regard to procurement and financial management capacity; (iii) discuss potential strategies for evaluation of the HDSPP project; and (iv) discuss targeting options for selecting beneficiaries. The team held discussions with the Joint Secretary of the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP); the project management team headed by Under Secretary/HDSPP Project Manager from the Population and Vital Event Registration Section (PVERS) of MoLD; the Joint Secretary of Ministry of Education (MOE); the National Program Manager of LGCDP and the Social Protection donor group (SPTT). 2. This Aide-Mdmoire summarizes progress of project implementation, issues discussed during the Review, and agreements reached on the key next steps. The review findings and recommendations were discussed in a pre wrap-up meeting with the Joint Secretary and Project Management Team and later discussed and agreed in a wrap-up meeting with the Secretary of MoLD on Nov. 25, 2011. 3. The review team is grateful to the Government counterparts, in particular, MoLD and MOE, development partners and other stakeholders for their cooperation during the consultation. I.  Summary of review Findings  4. The grant agreement between Government of Nepal (GON) and the World Bank was signed on August 19, 2011 and the Memorandum of Understanding between GON and UNCDF was signed in November 2011. However, preparatory work had taken place prior to signing the agreements. Disbursement under the recipient-executed (RE) grant has not yet begun. 5. Project implementation is progressing relatively well, with actions taking place in parallel to address the short implementation timeframe. Progress towards the project development objective (PDO) is on track considering the grant signing date. Detailed implementation procedures are prepared; and poverty-based beneficiary targeting designs, MIS design, evaluation and payment mechanisms are all either completed or under finalization. Terms of Reference and Request for Proposal documents for the household (HH) registration have been sent for the Bank's review and no objection. The HH registration process is expected to be fielded by February 2012 covering an estimated 80,000 households in all VDCs in the two selected districts (Kanchanpur and Dadeldhura). 6. GON and UNCDF have extended the project closing date to July 2013, while the closing date of the Bank-administered grant (Rapid Social Response Multi Donor Trust Fund - RSR grant) is September 30, 2012. Both GON and the co-financier (UNCDF) have expressed concern about the RSR Grant closing date, with the same concerns shared by the Bank team. MoLD requested the Bank team to ' The composition of the review/consultations team is illustrated in annex 1.  2 explore the possibility of extending the grant closing date to align it with the current GON/UNCDF closing date. MoLD informed the review team that an official request for extension will be sent to the Bank in the coming weeks. During the consultation, targeting methods for selection of households were agreed. A mix of 7. Proxy Means Testing (PMT) and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) will be used and evaluated for performance. It was also agreed that the HH registration process will serve three purposes i.e. HDSPP targeting, local planning and vital registration. The scope and functional requirements of the MIS system were finalized and agreed, and the scope, key design features and research questions of the pilot evaluation were also agreed. Terms of Reference and Requests for Proposals for service delivery of these program process steps are under development, and the review team urges MoLD to pursue timely implementation over the following weeks and months. The review of the main cash transfer programs implemented by MoLD (funded under the 8. Bank-executed grant) was completed. Review findings and recommendations were presented and discussed in a workshop organized by MoLD on November 28, 2011 with the participation of Government representatives (Local Development, Education, Health, Women and Social Affairs, etc), development partners and the banking sector, The coming weeks are critical to ensure timely launching of the HH registration process and 9. procuring essential services to support implementation (e.g. MIS, benefit payments). Hence, the review team strongly recommends very close monitoring of the agreed actions as detailed in Section VI. As important, MoLD needs to that ensure sufficient procurement and financial management (FM) capacity is provided to achieve timely and quality implementation. III.  Review, issues and recommendations of the pilot design and system development  Extensive technical discussions were held by the review team and the government team on 10. refining the pilot project design, the key program operations systems throughout the program cycle and the implementation timeframe. The subsequent sections outline these discussions, recommendations and agreements. Information and communication campaign: A draft information and communications strategy 11. has been prepared. The strategy outlines the main issues pertinent to HDSPP communication activities. Three main strategic communication priorities have been identified to support the HDSPP's efforts to: increase participation in household registration; increase the accountability of the targeted educational scholarship; and advocate for the adoption of successful piloted innovations. Target audience, communication methods and the key messages and information to be conveyed are summarized in the strategy paper. Next steps are to finalize the strategy and start work on producing the communication materials including timeline and strategy implementation plan. MOLD will finalize the strategy (with UNCDF support) by December 15 and launch the campaign by January 15, 2012 and a month before HH registration starts. The information and communication strategy will be approved by the Steering Committee. Household Registration: A complete and functional household registration system serves as a 12. solid basis for planning and budgeting purposes and helps to identify households who qualify for different programs or potentially need support. The pilot will support the two project districts (Kanchanpur and Dadeldhura) in updating and computerizing the existing household registers and assist VDC secretaries in keeping these registers updated. The registration data will be used to identify eligible households for participation in the pilot program. MoLD has a particular interest in revitalizing the family folders, and the registration activity will support the VDCs in creating a family folder per household registered. The  3 information collected will also assist VDCs in identifying wards / households without the necessary certificates and provide the means to double-check the present beneficiary lists for the social grants. 13. Targeting: To test the effectiveness of approaches other than the current categorical targeting in reaching the poorest households, Poverty-based targeting has been agreed to be one of the key design features of HDSPP. Discussions during the review have concerned the exact methodology for identifying the poor. The main options explored and discussed extensively during the consultation include targeting based on Proxy Means Testing (PMT) and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). The PMT approach is an established targeting methodology that ranks households according to their predicted per capita consumption levels. The MPI seeks to by-pass consumption-based ranking of household by considering a three-dimensional index of deprivations. The proposed three dimensions include economic wellbeing (or standard of living), education, and social exclusion with each dimension assigned an equal weight. While both PMT and MPI approaches support poverty targeting, simulations reveal that they are likely to rank households differently and produce different beneficiary lists. 14. It has been agreed that the HDSPP will use both the PMT and MPI for targeting and will assess their respective performance. It is proposed that one of the pilot districts will target households using the PMT, while the other pilot district will use the MPI for targeting. In both districts adequate information for computing both the PMT and MPI scores will be collected through the HH registration process, resulting in two lists. While only one of these lists will be used to select beneficiaries, the two lists are required for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of each method. A targeting evaluation exercise will compare the PMT and MPI household rankings from a sample of VDCs to community rankings of those households. Next steps include: (i) updating the PMT and MPI formulas; (ii) finalizing the targeting section of the registration form to reflect any changes in the PMT and MPI formulas; and (iii) finalizing the evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness of PMT and MPI targeting. These steps will be supported by World Bank and UNCDF technical teams and will be finalized by December 30, 2011. 15. Verifications and Grievance: The processes for verifying the accuracy of information collected during registration and for supporting households to register complaints - both with regards to the accuracy of registration information and with regards to the final targeting decision - were discussed in detail with counterparts from MoLD, MoE, and UNCDF. It was decided that the information gathered during registration will be self-attested by households at the time of registration. Households will be required to provide the relevant vital event registration certificates (such as birth certificates) in order to qualify for the scholarship. If a household is unable to provide the required vital event certificate, the household will be given a grace period during which they may submit the certificate and/or school enrollment records to the VDC secretary. During the grace period, the VDC secretary will maintain a list of households that have submitted additional vital event certificates. The registration firm will collect this information at the end of the grace period. VDC secretaries will be required to sign off on the basic details of each household (such as the number of children) after registration but will not be required to attest to all details collected during registration. Due to cost and time constraints, households will not be provided a copy of the data collected during registration either at the time of registration or afterwards. 16. It was further decided that households would be given an opportunity to register a complaint if they feel that they have been unfairly excluded from the program. In a separate discussion on targeting, it was decided that the ward citizens' forums would be allowed to recommend additional households which they feel have been unfairly excluded from the scholarship program. The final decision of excluded beneficiaries will be taken by District Social Protection Coordination Committee (DSPCC) based on the complaints submitted trough Village Development Committee (VDC). The grievance process will be timed so that those households with a complaint may register this complaint before the  4 ward citizens' forum makes a decision on which additional households to nominate (details of the process and timeframe to be worked out in the operations manual). Management Information System: The Terms of Reference drafted for the design, 17. development and implementation of the MIS system broadly covers two tasks: (i) Task 1 addresses the immediate MIS/IT needs for HDSP pilot implementation, (ii) Task 2 is to build a comprehensive MIS system with an aim to automating all Cash Transfer programs under the MoLD (except the Cash for Work program) into a single MIS IT platform thereby establishing a I wide system. While a single TOR has been developed comprising the above two tasks, Task 1 is funded under HDSPP and Task 2 will be funded by the Social Safety Net Project (SSNP). Key functions of the MIS system include: automating all Cash Transfer programs into a single MIS platform, maintaining an applicant and beneficiary database, generating eligible beneficiary lists for cash payments, and generating various MIS reports for planning and monitoring purposes. The MIS scope of work covers all the necessary IT services required to address the needs 18. outlined for both Task I and Task 2 such as IT implementation support staff in 12 districts for handholding, capacity building and MIS user training at various levels (center, districts, VDC staff) for further scaling up by the I in the remaining districts. The scope also includes the data network connectivity at the I, District and some VDCs for MIS implementation as well as the procurement of necessary hardware (such as servers, UPS, printers, switches) and other IT equipment such as computer chairs and tables, laptops etc. The service provider will establish a robust data center for hosting MIS databases and servers including the provision of establishing the data backup site for regular MIS data backups. Importantly, the underlying design architecture of the proposed MIS system is expected to be highly secure, modular and open architecture to address the current and future system integration aspects and scalability (such as linkages with the Vital Events systems, National ID, EMIS, Pension system etc). Evaluation: The strategy for evaluating the various components of the pilot was discussed with 19. counterparts from MoLD, MoE, and UNCDF. Given the pilot nature of the project, evaluation will be particularly important as it will be critical to learn which of the various components of the project are effective and which are not. Therefore, the evaluation will be limited to the overall objectives of HDSPP and the identified intermediate results reviewed by the team. Key research questions related to these intermediate results and for which the evaluation will 20. seek answers were presented and discussed. Given the decision to pilot the use of both the MPI and PMT for targeting, it was agreed that comparing the relative effectiveness of these two targeting methods will be particularly important. Given the short time span of the project as well as the nature of the project focus on process 21. modalities and delivery approaches, it was agreed that it is not feasible to undertake rigorous impact evaluations of the effect of scholarship grants on education outcomes. Process studies will be used to assess administrative and other processes to shed light on the use of performance incentives, the implementation of the new MIS, the payment mechanism and other project activities. In addition, the evaluation will include a cost effectiveness study to estimate the relative cost effectiveness of the pilot intervention versus other potential interventions.  5 IV.  Implementation Progress of the Bank-administered grant  Progress towards Project Objectives 22. The specific objective to be achieved by the activities supported under the Bank-administered grant is " to improve the delivery of cash-based social safety nets in pilot districts of Nepal through technical assistance and capacity building to the I ofLocal Development". 23.  The agreed end of project targets are: * *  90% of intended pilot beneficiaries receive cash transfers on time according to Pilot Operational Guidelines; and 80% of pilot transfer recipient households report satisfaction with program implementation.  24. As project signing took place only in August 2011, it is too early to assess the outcomes as delivery of scholarships has not begun. However, specific implementation actions under all three components are progressing towards achieving the project objective. Detailed implementation procedures have been prepared and a draft operations manual is under review. Project management and support teams at central as well as regional levels are appointed, the central team is functional and the regional team will be fully functional by early January 2012. A draft communication strategy has been developed, district selection completed and the household targeting methodology is being finalized. Terms of Reference and Requests for Proposals for the HH registration, MIS development, and payment delivery are under review by the Bank and UNCDF teams. Lastly, the project evaluation scope and research questions have been agreed, and the Terms of Reference for the evaluation services are under preparation. Procurement of evaluation services is expected by February 2012. Despite this good progress, as a result of the short implementation period due to the current closing date of the trust fund (RSR-MDTF) and further restrictions due to the delay in processing the grant agreements, there is a significant risk that a number of key interventions (e.g. evaluation) will not be completed by the grant closing date of September 30, 2012. Component progress 25. Component 1: Strengthening institutional capacity to design and implement the HDSP (US$ 0.8 million). This component provides technical assistance and training to develop the project systems. Four elements were identified to be supported: (i) a review of current cash transfer programs; (ii) design of operational systems including targeting, enrollment, payment, and case management; (iii) design of a web portal and Management Information System (MIS) where the MIS will be integrated at the central and local DDC/VDC levels with technical assistance provided to establish monitoring mechanisms for schools, banks or other payment centers, communities and households; and (iv) training and capacity building on system implementation at central and local levels. The major portion of this component is managed by the Bank team using the Bank-administered portion of the grant. 26. A thorough review of key cash transfer programs (e.g. old age pension, single women allowance, and disability allowance) implemented by MoLD was conducted. As part of the review, the systems and processes of these programs were documented in depth. In addition, the strengths and weaknesses of the cash transfer program were analyzed and several recommendations for program improvements were proposed. Results from the review were presented and discussed in detail with counterparts from the Population and Vital Events Registration Section. Further, the review findings and recommendations were presented and discussed in a workshop on November 28, 2011 with the participation of Government representatives (Local Development, Education, Health, Women and Social Affairs, etc), development partners and the banking sector. The review findings and recommendations  6 provide good guidance for HDSPP implementation as well as ongoing policy dialogue on the delivery of cash transfers. The final report will be delivered to MoLD by December 15, 2011. Technical assistance has been provided by the World Bank and UNCDF for the design of the 27. operational systems including all elements that are presented and discussed in Section II of this aide memoire. Revisions to the operational systems as agreed during the review will be incorporated in the project documents and shared for wider dissemination/consultations in a planned national workshop in January 2012. The functional requirement of the MIS, technical specifications, and ToRs/RFPs for procuring MIS/IT services are under finalization. It is expected that the EOI for MIS/IT services will be advertized by December 20, 2011. A draft project operations manual has been prepared with support from the UNCDF team. It was agreed to revise/finalize the manual based on the review findings and agreements by January 15, 2012. The UNCDF team will take the lead in supporting MoLD to finalize the operations manual. The Operation Manual will be approved by MOLD. The Terms of Reference and other relevant procurement documents for the household 28, registration service were reviewed during this consultation. ToRs will need to be revised to reflect the decisions reached with the team. MoLD will send the revised ToRs/EOI to the Bank for no objection by December 10, 2011. Component 2: Implementation of the HDSPP (US$ 0.6 million). The component provides 29. goods and services required to implement the pilot in the two selected districts (Kanchanpur and Dadeldhura). Among other activities implementation will involve: (i) provision of core computer hardware for local offices; (ii) supplies and forms for enrollment; (iii) creation of the beneficiary database; (iv) establishing the MIS system and necessary connectivity between localities and the center; and (v) providing linkages with payment systems. Specific items will be agreed jointly with MoLD, UNCDF and the Bank teams. The cash transfer payments to beneficiaries in the pilot districts are provided through UNCDF funding. The scholarship grants are funded by UNCDF and are expected to cover 24,000 poor students 30. in grades (1-8) in the two selected districts (Kanchanpur and Dadeldhura). Terms of Reference and RFP packages for payment service providers are under finalization. A briefing workshop for interested service providers was organized and delivered by UNCDF/MoLD in May 2011. The EOI is expected to be advertized by December 20, 2011. The review team revisited the implementation schedule and it expected that the first payment 31. to students will only be delivered in August 2012 (Annex 2). This means the project would have delivered only one of three payments by the Bank-administered grant closing date (September 30, 2012). MoLD and UNCDF have extended the project closing date to July 2013. Component 3: Evaluating the HDSPP (US$ 0.6 million). This component supports the 32. design and implementation of an evaluation of the pilot program. The Bank is providing technical assistance through the Bank-executed grant for the evaluation design, implementation support and data analysis. MoLD will hire a national firm to undertake the evaluation activities in the field and the data entry. During review, as elaborated in Section II, the scope of work and types of evaluation studies have been discussed and agreed. The Bank will work with MoLD to finalize the evaluation design note and  7 prepare ToRs for an international evaluation consultant, as well as the ToRs for the national firm by December 30, 2011.  Implementation arrangement and capacity 33. The project has implementation arrangements at three levels: national, district and local. At the national level, the Steering Committee, chaired by MoLD and co-chaired by MOE, makes decisions regarding the structure and processes of the pilot. The Steering Committee includes members from MoLD, MoE, MoF, NPC, and donor representatives (as observers). To date there have been three Steering Committee meetings held. These meetings have been fruitful in ensuring all engaged stakeholders are up to date on the project achievements as well as providing the project with policy and design guidance. However the technical committee that was agreed on has yet to be formed, though recent discussions suggest that its role may not be necessary. The day-to-day management of the pilot lies with the Vital Registration and Population Section (VRPS)/LGCPD. A Safety Net Specialist has also joined MoLD and has been supporting the ministry in that capacity for the last five months. This specialist has been critical in ensuring coordination and improved pace of implementation. Support by the External TA Pool (including on TA on targeting, MIS, evaluation, payment) has been provided by the Bank (through the Bank-executed grant) and UNCDF. 34. Implementation arrangements at the district and local levels reflect the national level institutional arrangement. Coordination is to be led by District Social Security Committee chaired by District Development Committee (DDC) with support from District Education Office (DEO) and a DDC co-chaired sub-committee on education. In addition, for implementation support to the VRPS sub-section at the district level, there will be a MIS specialist and a social protection coordinator for each district. At the local Village Development Committee (VDC) level, support to the VDC will be through existing entities i.e.: Identity Card Recommendation Committee (ICRC) and Village Education Committee (VEC). These will be supported by a Social Mobilizer, School Management Committee, Community Learning Center, Citizen Awareness Center and District Team are all planned. 35. Progress at the district and local level: the recruitment process for a MIS specialist and a social protection coordinator for each district has been completed with the expectation that they will be in place by January 1, 2012. Given the range of actors, clarity on mandates of each entity and clear communication about the specific roles of each entity needs to be worked on further elaborated in operations manual (Chapter 2). Implementation Schedule 36. Detailed discussions on the implementation timeframe made it clear that despite plans for an increase in the implementation pace in the coming days and weeks, the first payments to the beneficiaries would not be made before August 2012. With the current closing date of the Bank-administered grant, pilot evaluation activities can not implemented. This would mean a lost opportunity to test the effect of the new approaches and modalities to delivering cash transfers and hence the project can be evaluated for achievement of its objectives. This was raised as an issue of great concern by the Government and coFinancier. The Government informed the team at the last HDSP steering committee meeting that the project was extended until end of July 2013 by MoLD and UNCDF. MoLD requested the Bank to explore the possibility for grant extension to align with the June 2013 date and informed us of an official request will be sent to the Bank soon  8 Procurement A comprehensive procurement plan (PP) for the current FY 2011-12 already cleared by the 37. Bank was discussed during the review. The PP includes procurement of goods, consulting services and non-consulting services. Considering the project span to be only one year, most of the procurement activities have been planned to be initiated simultaneously. This has created an increased work load for the project procurement team. Staff that have been working on the project procurement over the last few months do not have adequate procurement experience and skill to prepare procurement documents. The issue of procurement capacity was raised by the review team. MoLD agreed to provide procurement support through the LGCDP procurement team. The review team strongly recommends the provision of continuous procurement support to enable timely and quality implementation of the procurement activities over the following weeks. If needed the project could consider hiring a procurement consultant. Discussions also focused on the planned procurement activities in terms of the need for better 38. slicing and packaging of some activities, cost estimates to reflect current market rates and size of slices, and the addition of new procurement activities as needed. The procurement of consulting services for registration and the MIS system design and development were discussed in depth from technical, procurement and budget perspectives. In order to reflect all these changes and requirements, it was agreed that MoLD will revise/update the current PP and submit to the Bank for its review and clearance  by December 10, 2011.  Financial Management IDA financial management (FM) team discussed the status of initial actions needed in order to 39. initiate financial activities under World Bank-administered Trust Fund. The project reported that they are in the process of completing those actions and will inform the team in due course. A qualified accounts officer was assigned during the review. The team suggested the project move quickly on these key actions at the earliest possible time as these are necessary to initiate disbursements under this Trust Fund. Pending key actions to be undertaken by MOLD include: subconsultation of the authorized signatory letter, opening of the Nepalese Rupee designated account at Nepal Rastra Bank, and registration in the client Connection. V. 40.  Donor Coordination and Consultation The review team participated in the Social Protection Development Partners group (SPTT)  meeting held on November 21, 2011.  Participants included representatives of UNICEF, ILO, WFP,  ADB, UNCDF and WB. A number of these representatives have participated in previous discussions during project preparation. The review team presented an update on the project design and implementation progress. The team presented targeting options under consideration as well as key evaluation questions. The group stressed that the targeting approach should enhance social cohesion by ensuring that local communities are aware of and support the basis on which beneficiaries are selected. The group supported the project focus on evaluation to enable testing the new approaches to the management and delivery of cash transfers, while at the same time stressing the need to avoid loading  the evaluation design with elements irrelevant to the specific objectives of the pilot. To inform policy, the group advised to add a cost effectiveness analysis to the evaluation in order to compare the cost of delivering cash transfers using the new modalities versus the current practice. 41. The review team appreciates the input and insight provided during these discussions and reflected the discussion points in the follow-on meetings with the government. The review team  9 informed the group about the workshop planned by MoLD on November 28, 2011 to present the findings of the cash transfer programs review undertaken by the World Bank.  V.

Located in the Himalaya mountain range, the country is greatly impacted by global climate change and struggles with both water scarcity in some areas and increased flooding in others. Supporting progress toward a democratic, resilient and prosperous Nepal is a priority for U.S. development efforts. USAID_programs_in_Nepal seek to reinforce recent gains in peace and security, stabilize the transitional government, strengthen the delivery of essential social services, expand proven health interventions, and address the global challenges of food insecurity and climate change.  ***** LEARN MORE ***** Nepal_Country_Profile USAID/Nepal_Mission_Director  ***** Partnership Opportunities ***** Conflict_Management_and_Mitigation_Annual_Program_Statement_(APS)_2014 ***** Blog ***** Will_Our_Generation_be_Responsible_for_Killing_Off_the_Tiger?

Comprehensive Peace Accord in November 2006, laying out a roadmap to a lasting peace and the construction of a new governance structure. Constituent Assembly (CA) elections were peacefully held on April 10, 2008, creating the structure to draft a new constitution. Political parties are currently engaged in reaching consensus on the country's future political and administrative form. With an average annual per capita income of US$490 (WB, 2011) the population of 26.6 million is culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse. There are three distinct eco-zones- the mountains, the hills and the terai plains - running north to south and five east-to-west development regions. Poverty has significantly declined from 310% in 2003/2004 to 250%in 20101/2011 and Nepal has reached its MDG 1 target related to the eradication of extreme poverty - reducing poverty by half - ahead of time (WB, 2012). Higher poverty rates exist among minorities, lower caste and certain tribal groups but inequality in consumption expenditure has declined over the last 5 years (Nepal Living Standard Survey III - NLSS III). B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 2. Nepal's health indicators have shown rapid and impressive improvements over the last 10 years. The country is on track to reach the MDG targets related to Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Ratio and HIV/AIDS. However, anticipated diminishing returns from investments in on-going programs will slow down the progress unless additional interventions are put in place. The Ministry of Health and Population, together with development partners and other stakeholders are working closely through a Sector-wide Approach to keep Nepal on track to reach these health related MDG targets by scaling up selected programs and putting in place new initiatives. The proportion of deliveries attended by the skilled birth providers over the last five years has nearly doubled, from 19% in 2006 to 36% in 2011 (DHS). The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) declined significantly from 530 per 100,000 live births in 1996 to 281 in 2006 (DHS 2006), a trend consistent with the data from 2009 which showed an MMR of 229 per 100,000 live births (Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Survey, 2009). The Total Fertility Rate has declined from 3.1 (2006) to 2.6 (2011) and the percentage of children fully immunized against major preventable illness increased from 83.5% (DHS 2006) to 87% (DHS 2011). From 2006 to 2011, the under five mortality has declined from 61 (DHS 2006) to 54 (DHS 2011) per 1,000 live births but the neonatal mortality has remained the same and the pace of improvement in post neonatal and infant mortality has slowed down. The prevalence of HIV in Nepal is below 0.5%, the treatment success rate for tuberculosis treatment has increased to over 84% and only a single death due to malaria has been reported during the first and second trimesters of FY 2010/11. Significant progress has been seen in reducing micronutrient deficiencies over the past decade and consistent semi-annual Vitamin A supplementation to children 6-59 months covers >90% of children. Similarly, the household consumption of adequately iodized salt has risen to almost 80% and the iron and folic acid supplementation and de-worming during pregnancy has made progress (NDHS 2011). 3. In contrast to these improvements in health indicators, Nepal is not on track to reach the MDG Ic target - to reduce the rate of malnutrition by half - and has a very high  1  rate of child malnutrition with 46.7% of children under five being stunted, 15.1% being wasted and 36.3% being underweight (NLSS III, 2010/11). Although there is a declining trend compared to the rates 5 years ago, these rates are still alarmingly high. The economic costs of malnutrition are very high - an estimated 2-3% of GPD (US$250 to 375 million) is lost every year in Nepal due to vitamin and mineral deficiencies alone. Improving nutrition contributes to productivity, economic development, and poverty reduction by improving physical work capacity, cognitive development, school performance, and by reducing disease and mortality. The window of opportunity for improving nutrition is small - the 1000 days from the first day of pregnancy through the first two years of life. The damage to physical growth, brain development, and human capital formation that occurs during this period due to inadequate nutrition is extensive and largely irreversible. The main focus in Nepal in improving nutrition therefore is to accelerate the reduction of child malnutrition. Interventions must therefore focus on the risk factors that influence nutritional outcomes during this critical period. 4. In general, for an individual woman or child, the basic causes of maternal and child malnutrition are: insufficient intake and absorption of nutrients, and excessive energy expenditure. The risk factors for insufficient intake of nutrients include: poor economic and social access to food, lack of knowledge about the nutritious value of foods and which foods are required at specific times (e.g. pregnancy, young children), poor feeding practices for children, gender dynamics that dictate that women should eat last and least, cultural beliefs about eating down during pregnancy and the need to limit weight gain to avoid having large babies and thus increase the risk of complicated delivery, smoking during pregnancy and indoor air pollution during pregnancy which reduce the capacity of blood to carry oxygen to body tissues. Similarly, insufficient weight gain before and during pregnancy and adolescent pregnancies limit the availability of nutrients to the foetus, because the mother and foetus are competing for nutrients. The risk factors for insufficient absorption of nutrients include: poor hygiene and environmental sanitation that cause diarrhea and other infections that limit the gut's ability to absorb nutrients, the presence in the diet of certain "anti-nutrients" such as phytates which bind with iron and limit its absorption in the body and infections with parasites (e.g. helminths) that compete with the host's body for nutrients. The risk factors for excessive energy expenditure relate to the metabolic rate increases caused by infections, and excessive physical workloads of women before and during pregnancy. 5. In Nepal, these risk factors for young child malnutrition emerge at an early stage in the life-cycle. Almost one in five (18.2%) women of reproductive age in Nepal has chronic energy deficiency (Body Mass Index <18.5)1, compromising the additional energy requirements during pregnancy. There is significant cultural and family pressure to marry and give birth at an early age in Nepal. The median age at first birth has remained constant around 20 years of age over the 2001, 2006 and 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys, evidence that social and cultural attitudes regarding early childbearing continue to be prevalent. It is estimated that some 12 to 16% of children in Nepal are born with a low birth weight. Other prevalent risk factors include anemia among pregnant women, excessive physical workloads, indoor air pollution and smoking during pregnancy, poor hygienic practices and, related, frequent episodes of illnesses such as diarrhea. Body Mass Index is defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Normal weight is defined as a BMI of 19.8-26 1  2  6. Current infant and young child care practices, from immediately after birth and up to the age of 24 months, point to the next set of risk factors for child stunting. Particular problems in Nepal are low levels of early initiation of breastfeeding and the either early or late introduction of complementary feeding with a low quality complementary feeding diet. Exclusive breastfeeding rates declined between 2001 and 2006 but improved significantly between 2006 and 2011. The Lancet Nutrition Series (LNS)2 calculated that quality implementation of breastfeeding and complementary feeding interventions (possibly including supplementary food) could reduce infant mortality and stunting at 12 months by 11.6% and 19.8% respectively. Delays in health care seeking behavior often results in more serious and prolonged conditions among children, taking an unnecessarily heavy toll on their nutritional status. Young children in Nepal suffer from frequent infections such as diarrhea and too often care takers do not know how to properly treat diarrhea, as witnessed by the very low rates (less than 10 per cent) of utilization of zinc with oral rehydration solution (ORS) to treat diarrhea. 7. Community - wide factors constitute risks for malnutrition that are independent from the life-cycle. The availability of an appropriate variety of food products is problematic in a number of districts, as is the accessibility in terms of the costs of food items. Poor access to safe drinking water and poor hygiene and sanitation practices contribute to the disease burden of communities with a negative impact on nutritional status, especially among children. Cultural beliefs and practices add important elements to the wide array of factors that perpetuate the intergenerational problem of malnutrition in Nepal. Also, despite improvements in female education in Nepal, the level of educational attainment is still a significant factor for malnutrition in Nepal (NLSS III, 2010/2011). There is a strong positive correlation between mothers' educational attainment and the nutritional status of her children. 8. To address the range and variety of risk factors described above requires coordinated action and resources from various sectors, agencies and actors, including communities. The Nepal Food Crisis Response program was initiated in 2008 as a response to soaring food prices and included support to public works programs, agriculture inputs and social protection. The program used the strength of community organizations to implement its programs quickly. The food security status of severely food insecure areas has considerably improved but the need to focus on nutrition remains critically important. The Nepal MultiSectoral Nutrition Plan (MSNP) represents Nepal's intention to address this requisite. The MSNP has recently been finalized, detailing the roles of the Ministry of Health and Population, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, the Ministry of Agricultural Development, and the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development, under the leadership of the National Planning Commission, in this effort. This planning framework is the result of collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders and sectors 3 . At the same time external development partners, through the Nepal Nutrition Group (NNG) and the Food Security Group, have improved the coordination of their interventions and analytical work. A number of The Lancet, "Maternal and Child Undernutrition," Special Series, January, 2008 The key stakeholders in Food and Nutrition Security in Nepal, besides GON, include, but are not restricted to, ADB, AusAID, DflD, EU, FAO, Hellen Keller International, IFAD, JICA, Jhpiego, the Micronutrient Initiative, Save the Children Nepal, SDC, SNV, TUFT University, UNDP, UNICEF, USAID, WFP, WHO, and The World Bank 2  3  nutrition and nutrition related projects are under preparation in parallel, the main ones being the USAID funded Suaahara Project and Feed the Future Project, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) financed Nepal Agriculture and Food Security Project and a large project by Heifer International working with small scale farmers. A list of on-going and planned projects in the area of Food and Nutrition Security in project districts is provided in Annex 9. C. Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes 9. The overarching goal of the Bank's Nepal Interim Strategy Note (ISN, Report No. 63381- NP, 2011) is to support the Government of Nepal to build a peaceful, prosperous and just Nepal. The Project will contribute to the higher level objective of the third pillar of the ISN Promoting Access to Better Quality Service and the nutrition indicators under this pillar. The Project will also support Nepal in its efforts to reach its MDG Ic target - to reduce the rate of malnutrition by half, consistent with the World Bank's endorsement of the Framework for Action for Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN). 10. The Project is also consistent with the World Bank's South Asia Regional Assistance Strategy (RAS) for Nutrition. The Project will interface with all the Ministries that are participating in the delivery of the multi-sectoral plan of action, working in close coordination with the National Planning Commission and directly through the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD). The World Bank South Asia RAS calls for inter-sectoral approaches to address nutrition within Bank operations, focusing on areas of Bank comparative advantages to better serve and support client countries to implement comprehensive programs that integrate critical nutrition-sensitive actions in multiple sectors.  II.  PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES A. PDO 11. The Development Objective for the Project is to improve attitudes and practices known to improve nutritional outcomes of women of reproductive age and children under the age of 2. Changes in attitudes and practices will address the key risk factors for child malnutrition and create demand for nutrition related services and products. The supply of these services and products will be provided through existing public sector and donor-funded programs, the private sector and, to a limited extent, financed through the Project. 12. Some of the targeted changes in practices would not necessarily result in improved nutritional outcomes during the project period since they address risk factors whose mitigation only delivers returns - impact - over a longer period. Postponing the age of first pregnancy, keeping girls in school and child spacing are examples of such practices. The Project Development Objective indicators, therefore, do not focus on impact but on changes in those attitudes and practices known to affect nutritional outcomes. The changes the Project aims to bring about are situated in the casual pathway for malnutrition as illustrated in Annex 6. 13. Targeted populations will choose from a "menu" of attitudes and practices to be improved that are most relevant for their specific situation. Depending on the choice, results  4  at community level will include improved hygiene practices (hand-washing and use of latrines); reduced smoking during pregnancy; reduced indoor air pollution; improved safety of drinking water; continued schooling for girls; delayed age of first pregnancy until at least the age of 20; improved dietary intake and diversity during pregnancy; increased consumption of micronutrient supplements during pregnancy; improved breastfeeding practices, improved feeding practices for children aged 6 to 24 months (frequency, micronutrient intake, continued feeding during illness etc.). The complete menu of "goals" is reflected in Annex 7. 14. The Project is designed primarily to address the risk factors for chronic malnutrition although Nepal has high levels of both chronic malnutrition (stunting and micronutrient deficiencies) as well as acute malnutrition (wasting). This focus was chosen because stunting reduction is the main focus of the Government of Nepal's Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Plan to which this project is aligned. This is technically sound because chronic malnutrition limits the development potential and future productivity of three times more children in Nepal than does acute malnutrition and the effects of chronic malnutrition are severe. Various forms of chronic malnutrition are associated with at least 30% of child deaths and with significant cognitive impairment (up to 25 IQ points loss when young children's diets are deficient in iron), leading to reductions in learning ability and productivity losses in adulthood. The interventions required to address acute malnutrition, such as community and facility based management of acute malnutrition are supported in parallel through the IDA financed Second HNP and HIV/AIDS Project. 15. The focus of the Project is on the period of conception up to the age of 24 months the First Thousand Days - since damage to physical growth, brain development, and human capital formation that occurs during this period due to inadequate nutrition is extensive and largely irreversible. Secondly, the increase in the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in Nepal is especially pronounced in the period from birth up the age of 24 months (NLSS III preliminary data). B. Project Beneficiaries 16. The Project will support a life-cycle approach, targeting the specific populations that are relevant to achieving the PDO: (1) girls and young women between 15 and 25 years of age; (2) pregnant women and women who may want to become pregnant in the next 6 months; (3) children 0-6 months of age and their caretakers; (4) children 6-24 months of age and their caretakers; and (5) communities involved in community-wide nutrition related interventions (such as hygiene, safe drinking water, sanitation, etc). Project interventions will be supported in 15 districts, which have been selected on the basis of a) stunting levels; b) population size; c) poverty levels; and d) the absence of interventions by other partners that focus on social mobilization. Within the selected districts, the Project will target 25% of the most disadvantaged Village Development Committees (VDCs), in total approximately 1,100 VDCs,  The project districts are in the central Terai: Parsa, Bara, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari, and Dhanusa; in the Central Hills: Makwanpur, Sindhuli and Ramechhap; in the Eastern Terai: Siraha, Saptari, and Sunsari; in the Eastern Hills: Okhaldunga, Khotang and Udayapur. 4  5  and operate in all wards of the selected VDCs 5 . The criteria for the selection of VDCs will follow the six indicators in use by MOFALD for the Disadvantaged Group (DAG) classification, relating to 1) food sufficiency of less than 3 months, 2) the presence of marginalized groups, 3) lack of access to basic services, 4) the lack of representation/participation of/by women, Dalits and janajati in decision-making bodies, 5) the prevalence of gender discrimination and 6) the presence of vulnerable groups. The total population in the Project districts is about eight million people in 1.5 million households (Census 2011), and representing 30% of the total population of Nepal. 17. Although rates of stunting are highest in the mountain and hill districts, the Terai is most affected in terms of the overall numbers of women and children (see Figure 1 below). Therefore, the Project will focus on the most populated areas in order to have the maximum impact. Figure 1: Number of women and children affected by malnutrition ('000s) 1,800 1,600 1,400 1,200 1,000 HTera  800  MNHS I  600 400  Mountains  -  200 0 Anemia in women  Low BMI among women  Anemia among U-5  Stunting among U-5  Source: World Bank, "Accelerating progress in reducing maternal and child under-nutrition in Nepal," 2011  C. PDO Level Results Indicators 18. The PDO level indicators will track improvements in: a) family planning practices of girls and young women aged 15-25 years; b) practices of pregnant women regarding iron and folic acid supplementation; c) breastfeeding practices of mothers with children 0-6 months of age; d) child feeding practices of households with children 6 to 24 months of age; e) attitude of community members towards the importance of keeping girls school until age 20; f) attitude of community members towards the importance of reducing indoor air pollution and g) attitudes of pregnant women towards their dietary needs. Annex 1 provides the complete Results Framework, including a description of key attitudes and practices that will be measured and how monitoring and evaluation under the project will be designed and implemented.  5  Nepal has 75 districts, districts are divided in a number of VDCs, depending on the population size. There are 3914 VDCs nationwide and every VDC has 9 wards. Below the ward level are settlements.  6  III.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 19. The Project will roll out a social mobilization initiative through a community-driven "Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiative" (RRNI) where each ward in a selected VDC will commit to a series of pre-defined nutrition relevant goals, each to be met within a 100-day period. The achievement of the goals will be the responsibility of RRNI teams, one for each ward, supported by a coach who will support all RRNI teams in one VDC. 20. The Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives approach will be introduced in two VDCs prior to the start of the Project. The lessons learned from this early introduction of the RRNI approach will be incorporated into a final Operations Manual (OM). It will then be rolled out under the Project in a sequenced manner across the 15 project districts. 21. The Project does not operate in isolation and a range of relevant services, projects and resources are already available in all selected districts. These include services from all public sectors, other Bank financed projects (the Poverty Alleviation Fund, the Social Safety Nets project, the Rural Water and Sanitation project), projects by UN agencies (WFP, UNICEF, UNFPA) and International NGOs (HKI, Heifer International), resources from GON district block grants and grants under the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP). The selected coaches working in a specific district will, in close collaboration with the district Nutrition and Food Security Steering Committee (NFSSC), make an inventory of all of these available services, projects and resources (the district map) prior to the initiation of RRNIs in the district in order to be able to provide this information to the communities so as to maximize the potential benefits from these resources. 22. Other project designs have been considered but regarded as less appropriate. A project using a variety of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) was contemplated. However, this approach was eventually rejected as beneficiaries of existing cash transfers in Nepal do not (fully) match the intended target groups necessary to achieve the PDO, and therefore, additional cash transfer mechanisms would need to be created. Obtaining firm assurances of continued financial resources to support these additional entitlements after the project would be highly unlikely and thus would pose a risk to the sustainability of project activities. Another option considered was to implement the project through the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP). However, this would add little value since the MOHP already assumes responsibility 6 for implementing all recommended nutrition related programs and the required scaling up of some of these programs is already supported by IDA through the Second HNP and HIV/AIDS Project. Lastly, the possibility of a project supporting nutrition relevant service delivery by a range of implementing agencies was also considered but found to be less relevant as it would not comprehensively address the demand side and the social determinants of malnutrition. A. Project Components 23. Component 1 (estimated US$34.86 million): Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives at the ward level. This component will support the entire RRNI process. It will start at a Ward 6  World Bank, "Accelerating progress in reducing maternal and child under-nutrition in Nepal," 2011  7  Citizen Forum where, invited by the LGCDP social mobilizer, key nutrition challenges of the community will be discussed. Assisted by a coach at the ward level, the Ward Citizen Forum will select a nutrition relevant goal from a menu of goals (see Annex 7). A RRNI team will be formed at the ward level that will set an appropriate and realistic target for meeting the goal and pledge to achieve the goal within a 100-day period by mobilizing the community and finding the best approach to achieving the target in their particular context. The RRNI team will prepare a Work Plan which will outline the needed inputs to achieve the goal and enter into a Grant Agreement with the VDC, stipulating that the Work Plan will be implemented in accordance with the provisions and guidelines stipulated in the Operations Manual. 24. The Work Plan might require physical inputs and/or inputs by the community such as reaching out to the selected target groups in a variety of ways to change critical behaviors and practices that affect nutrition outcomes. The Work Plan will be submitted for review to the NFSSC at the VDC level if the total value is below US$1,000 equivalent and to the NFSSC at the DDC level if the total value is between US$1,000 and the maximum of US$3,000 equivalent. Depending on the needs outlined in the Work Plan, the NFSSCs will be tasked to ensure that the necessary inputs are provided to the RRNI team. This will entail coordinating inputs from various relevant agencies, such as Health and Population, Education, and Agricultural Development, etc. Once the inputs are provided to the ward, the 100-day RRNI will begin. 25. There will be a mid-term assessment by the RRNI team with assistance from the coach and an end-of the 100 days initiative evaluation by the team of whether it was able to meet the goal and a presentation of the results to the Ward Citizen Forum. At the same occasion, the RRNI team will account for the use of inputs, financial or otherwise, and the end-of the 100 days initiative evaluation will effectively serve as a public audit of the initiative as well. Modalities for sustaining and expanding the achievement will be an important topic during the evaluation of the 100 days RRNI. 26. Results of the initiatives will be recorded and maintained by NFSSCs and lessons of successful and innovative projects will be disseminated to other communities to ensure maximum learning. Similarly, unsuccessful initiatives will be reviewed in order to extract valuable lessons for other communities in order to continue making improvements, possibly refining RRI goals. Each ward will be encouraged to carry out several RRNIs each year, focusing on different goals. 27. Component 2 (estimated US$5.14 million): Project Management, Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation. This component will provide support for the implementation of Component 1 under three sub-components: (i) capacity enhancement of the Project Management Team, including Cluster Units, and NFSSCs, as well as of coaches and social mobilizers. NFSSCs at DDC and VDC levels will receive training and project management support to ensure that they are able to review and process work plans and secure necessary supplies at the village level. Support to NFSSCs at DDC and VDC levels will go beyond Project specific activities and include support in coordinated planning and budgeting for nutrition relevant activities across sectors to be incorporated in the district block grants. Coaches at the VDC level will receive appropriate training and materials on the RRNI process in order to ensure high quality of work plans. The training and the development of the materials will be contracted to a consultancy  8  firm; (ii) providing necessary inputs (consultants, goods and operating costs) for effective project management at national, DDC and VDC levels; and (iii) ensuring monitoring and evaluation of the Project, including the evaluation of the RRNI process through routine and third-party monitoring. This includes financing of a mid-line and end-line survey as well as financing annual conferences (sponsored by the National Planning Commission) where findings and innovations of successful RRNI teams will be presented. as well as whether the expected outcomes of the Rapid Results initiatives were achieved. Evaluation of the program is one of the primary aims during implementation. Given that the evaluation is best achieved when the interventions are being designed, the GON and the Bank team have agreed to try and employ an experimental design for project roll-out to allow for a rigorous evaluation of program impacts. B. Project Financing Lending Instrument 28. The Lending Instrument for the Project is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), with a total amount of US$40 million to be financed by an IDA Credit of US$22 million and an IDA Grant of US$18 million. The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years with a Closing Date of June 30, 2017. Project Cost and Financing 29. The estimated project costs are provided in Table 1 below, and detailed costs are attached as part of Annex 2. Resources under two existing Trust Funds, the AusAID financed SUNITA Trust Fund and the Partnership for Transparency Fund will finance specific activities related to the Project such as the baseline survey, the early introduction of the RRNI approach, the training of the coaches and the third party monitoring. Table 1: Estimated Total Project Costs Project Components 1.Rapid results initiatives 2.Capacity enhancement/management  Project cost 34.86 5.14  Total Project Costs Total Financing Required  40.00 40.00  IDA Financing 34.86 5.14 40.00 40.00  % Financing 100 100 100  C. Lessons Learned 30. The project design builds on the lessons of the rapid results approach which has been used in a number of countries from Nicaragua to help improve agricultural yields, to Rwanda where two villages doubled the number of attended births in less than 100 days. In Madagascar, four districts quintupled the use of family planning services in 50 days, and the Health Ministry then began the program on a national scale. Kenya is using rapid results in virtually all its ministries; one campaign circumcised 40,000 men in two months, an important intervention for HIV/AIDS prevention. Villages in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Eritrea and other countries have used Rapid Results to improve local infrastructure as well - digging wells, constructing bridges and roads, building schools. The key to the success of the rapid results approach is the  9  motivation and confidence that are created by defining and monitoring results in short periods and the strong sense of community mobilization that results. In all these cases, the main barrier to achieving development results was the need to change behaviors, which is the challenge also faced in Nepal in addressing malnutrition. An important lesson from the experiences of these countries in implementing the rapid results approach has been the critical need to have well trained coaches who in turn enable communities to select the best members for the RRNI teams as well as to select the most appropriate goals and set realistic targets. This lesson is well-taken by the Project which plans to hire and train coaches throughout project implementation and to ensure that they have the necessary support in terms of materials and information. The rapid results approach is new to Nepal but there is indication that it should also work in the Nepali context, given the strong track record in Nepal of community-based development. The challenge of the project is that it will be carried out on a much larger scale than other rapid results initiatives have been so far. To mitigate this risk, the Project will be phased in slowly and gradually expanding to all 15 districts.  IV.  IMPLEMENTATION A. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 31. The National Planning Commission (NPC) will provide policy support in accordance with its mandate to coordinate Nepal's multi-secoral efforts in Food and Nutrition Security. The MOFALD will be the main implementing agency. There will be a regular information sharing mechanism between the NPC and MOFALD. Project implementation at MOFALD will be headed by a Project Director at the level of Joint Secretary. Under his leadership, a Project Management Team (PMT) will include a Project Coordinator at the level of Under-Secretary, an Accounts Officer who will be primarily responsible for ensuring efficient flow of funds for the project and for financial reporting to the Government and the Bank, a Monitoring & Evaluation Officer, a Social Mobilization Expert and a Procurement Expert. Besides the Project Management Team there will be other administrative and logistics staff to support the PMT as and when necessary. 32. A Project Coordination Committee, headed by a Joint Secretary (the Project Director) will be established, consisting of the Project Management Team and representatives from the line ministries of the health, education, agriculture sectors and other relevant agencies. This Committee will assist in addressing project specific issues related to policy dialogue and intersectoral coordination. 33. At the Regional level, support will be provided to the LGCDP Cluster units responsible for districts where the Project will be implemented. At the district level, support will be provided by the NFSSCs which will be responsible for reviewing RRNI Work Plans and coordinating the supply of necessary inputs for the RRNIs. 34. The Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives will use separate grants to the 15 districts for the purpose of the project to finance demand based sub-projects, relying on the established social mobilization mechanism within MOFALD's LGCDP. The implementation mechanism will focus on nutrition issues, through the involvement of NFSSCs at the district and 10  village levels. MOFALD will prepare the work program for this project under a separate budget heading that will appear in the government's budget (Red Book). The Project will have its own flow of funds mechanism under a separate budget line item. The NFSSCs will be charged to review Work Plans submitted by wards and to ensure that the necessary inputs are secured. In case inputs can be supplied through public sector programs this will entail NFSSCs coordinating their work closely with the district level representatives of the relevant Ministries, including Health and Population, Education and Agricultural Development. It will also entail NFSSCs facilitating a sub-project grant allocation for the RRNI to finance additional supplies through the public sector, if needed, or to procure supplies from the private sector. Each NFSSC at the VDC level will also coordinate closely with the coaches responsible for their VDCs to ensure that project implementation is as efficient as possible. Similarly, each coach will work closely with the Ward Citizen Forums to ensure that the RRNI Work Plans meet the selection criteria, including the composition of the RRNI team and the inclusion of eligible expenditures only, and that the implementation of RRNIs is carried out in accordance with the Work Plan. An Operations Manual (OM) for the RRNI Process to be developed will provide all the necessary guidance and information to staff involved in implementation at all levels, from ward to the central level. As a supplement to the OM, a simplified version of Guidelines for the Communities will also be prepared, which will be produced in Nepali language. The OM will also outline the responsibilities of staff at each level and the monitoring and reporting requirements. 35. A communications strategy is built into the Project. The Project Coordination Committee (PCC) at the central level, including representatives from the various line ministries and concerned agencies, will act as a platform for dissemination of information and advocacy and political mobilization. The implementing agency will further communicate with these ministries and other civil societies regularly by producing and distributing materials in English and Nepali languages and acquainting them about the Project, its importance and its progress as the Project gets implemented. At the ward level, the coaches and social mobilizers will be involved in RRNI information and mobilization by organizing key meetings and broadcasting through the local FM radios. This would encourage public participation by encouraging and empowering households to engage in this project for better nutrition of their children and women. B. Results Monitoring and Evaluation 36. Monitoring of the Project will entail activities that ensure transparency, accountability and inclusion. The monitoring indicators will be obtained from surveys and from routine data on physical and financial outputs. Results monitoring will concentrate on changes in attitudes and practices known to improve nutritional outcomes. A baseline survey will be carried out before the start of Project implementation. In addition to the attitudes and practices, the survey will also generate data on the intermediate outcomes such as the rate of teenage pregnancies, Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) indicators, the Household Dietary Diversity Score as well as outcome level indicators like the percentage of stunted children 0-24 months of age, and percentage of anemia in adolescent girls and pregnant women as baseline statistics. The success of the Project will also be measured by the number, coverage and success rates of the RRNIs.  11  37. Support for the Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project will include regular collection of data on the implementation of the Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives, data on the behaviors and practices which the RRNIs are expected to change, as well as data on the nutritional outcomes. There will be five aspects to the monitoring and evaluation framework financed by the component. First, the costs of mid-term, and end-term surveys to determine how key program indicators have changed during the course of project implementation. In addition to these three discrete monitoring events, the Project will also finance within year tracking surveys to assess developments in program areas, which will provide supporting information to assess the process of change. Second, the component will support third-party, independent verification of results of the RRNIs. This will also include an ethnographic component, where qualitative information to learn about and comprehend the cultural settings in which the program is placed and in an effort to appropriately reflect both the knowledge and practices in these different settings. Third, the component will support the overall evaluation of the project impacts. The GON and the Bank team have reached an agreement to use an innovative design to allow for a rigorous impact of program outcomes. Fourth, the component will finance learning events for coaches on a semi-annual basis in their districts where they will be able to share their experiences and to learn about successful and innovative projects. Finally, on an annual basis, there will also be a Nutrition Learning Forum organized by the National Planning Commission where results of the project will be presented and discussed, where innovative RRNIs and project lessons will be highlighted and where selected communities will be honored for their special achievements. 38. Beyond the monitoring of Project activities, support will also be provided to strengthen the overall monitoring and evaluation system for nutrition indicators and nutrition-related interventions in the districts. Through the support to NFSSCs nutrition related information from the health sector, the education sector, the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, the Ministry of Agricultural Development and MOFALD will be linked with the District Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System (DPMAS) at district level and with the Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System (PMAS) at central level. C. Sustainability 39. The Project aims to sustainably change attitudes and practices of intended beneficiaries so as to reduce risk factors for malnutrition. It is realized that a single RRNI in critical areas may not be sufficient to arrive at a sustained change in norms of practices. Wards will be encouraged to repeat some of the critical initiatives over the lifetime of the project, in particular those related to early pregnancy and child spacing, the preparation for pregnancy, smoking and indoor air pollution, hygiene, dietary diversity, infant feeding practices, including early and exclusive breastfeeding, and early care seeking behavior. Sustaining and expanding the achievements made during the 100 days initiatives will be a major topic for discussion with the Ward Citizen Forum during the end-of initiative evaluations. 40. The Project will help establish a sustained institutional mechanism for Food and Nutrition Security - and the RRNI approach - in each VDC through training and the financing of operational expenses. The training will include support in coordinated planning and  12  budgeting for nutrition relevant activities across sectors to be incorporated in the district block grants as a sustainable source of funding beyond the Project period. The NFSSCs at district and VDC level, as elaborated in Nepal's MSNP, will be provided with a standard training package that is being elaborated by a number of Food and Nutrition Security stakeholders in Nepal, such as the National Planning Commission, the Ministry of Agricultural Development, UNICEF, HKI, WFP and Reach. In addition, the existing social mobilizers recruited under MOFALD's LGCDP will be trained in the RRNI methodology. 41. Members of the RRNI teams will be trained in the conduct of peer programs and other social change methods7 in order to facilitate their work with their communities for the purpose of reaching the selected goal. This training will also allow them to continue working as agents of change in their communities after the RRNI has been completed.  V.  KEY RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES A.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY A. Economic and Financial Analysis 43. Nutritional interventions contribute significantly to the reduction of child and maternal mortality and physical and cognitive damages. Millions of mothers and children die globally and millions more are permanently disabled by mental and physical damage due to underlying causes of malnutrition early in life. The costs of irreversible physical and cognitive damage that children face due to malnutrition by 24 months of age are very large, and the impact of such damage has a strong intergenerational component. At the same time, there are wellproven interventions to reduce malnutrition available in Nepal. Recent analytical work commissioned by the Bank 8 has reviewed the evidence for essential nutrition interventions and provided the evidence base on what works for Nepal. 44. Nutritional interventions are among the most cost-effective interventions to enhance welfare and reduce poverty. In the Copenhagen Consensus 20089, a panel of renowned economists, ranked five nutritional interventions among thirty proposals presented to answer the question of the best way to advance global welfare. It ranked micronutrient supplements for children including vitamin A and zinc supplementation first, micronutrient fortification including iron and salt iodization third, de-worming and other nutrition programs at school sixth and community based nutrition promotion as ninth. The ranking takes into account the benefit cost ratio, feasibility and sustainability of the interventions. Investments in these interventions reduce poverty by enhancing productivity, cognitive development, and school performance. There is evidence showing the link between income/earning and nutritional status. At macro level, malnutrition could cause a significant loss of national income. In countries with high level of anemia, for instance, it is estimated to cause about 2% reduction in GDP. At the micro level, malnutrition causes a significant reduction in earning: a percentage decrease in adult height could result in up to 4% reduction in earnings. More importantly, improved nutrition will reduce maternal and child mortality. 45. Public investment in nutrition in Nepal, hence the Project, is justified both on equity grounds and on the grounds of market failure resulting from externality and limited information. Even when an investment in nutrition is worth making, there needs to be a well argued case for public involvement in those investments. From an economics perspective, there is a case from both an equity/poverty reduction perspective and market failure perspective that justifies the Project. There are two equity considerations that justify public investment in nutrition in Nepal. First, the burden of malnutrition falls disproportionately on the poor. According to the 2010 household survey, malnutrition is concentrated among the rural residents, households with illiterate women and the poorest. Moreover, the trend for the past decade shows that while malnutrition has declined nationally, this reduction is concentrated among the richest households. Hence, the fact that the poor are disproportionately affected by malnutrition is a good reason for public intervention. Furthermore, it is well established in the literature on the World Bank. 2012. Accelerating progress in reducing Maternal and Child Undernutrition in Nepal: A review of global evidence of essential nutrition interventions for the Nepal Health Sector Plan II and Multisectoral Nutrition Plan.  9 http://www.copenhazenconsensus.com/Projects/Copenhazen%20Consensus%202008-1.aspx. For further reading see Global crises, global solutions, edited by Bjorn Lomborg. Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004.  14  nutrition-poverty nexus that the poor are trapped in a low income - low nutrition equilibrium and public intervention is essential to breaking this vicious cycle. Second, in an economy where access to credit is limited, the opportunity to transfer assets inter temporally is limited especially for the poor. This is true for Nepal (see Besley, Jain and Tsangarides, 2001). 10 Although the returns to investments in nutrition are high and are common knowledge, such high return investments are beyond the reach of the poor due to credit constraints that the poor face. Public intervention can help relax such constraints facing the poor. Furthermore, people do not always have full information on the presence of malnutrition, of the severity, of its consequences or on ways to address it. Because growth faltering may be the norm, and micronutrient deficiencies are not typically visible enough to be easily recognized, communities are often unaware of the need to invest in improving the nutritional status of their children. The role of information is even more critical because of the limited window of opportunity where the highest impact on nutrition could be made. The benefit of improved nutrition accrues not only to the individual making the investment but to the society at large as improved nutrition reduces the impact of disease and improves national productivity. Such an absence of internalization of all the benefits of one's investments results in underinvestment in nutrition relative to that which is socially desirable. B. Technical 46. The Project builds on existing and upcoming nutrition programs in Nepal and fills an important gap for demand side interventions in nutrition. By focusing mainly on demand creation and community mobilization for nutrition-related behavior change, the Project complements the supply side interventions that are financed through large programs such as the Bank-financed health sector SWAp, investments in the education sector, poverty reduction initiatives and the upcoming Nepal Agriculture and Food Security program. Any potential overlap with the USAID-financed Suaahara and Feed the Future projects has been avoided as the projects will work in a different set of districts. 47. The Government of Nepal's MSNP describes target groups and prioritization and three main outcomes to which the Project is well aligned. The priorities and target groups indicate a focus on the first thousand days, the most deprived/most vulnerable, inclusive of all social groups, and geographic inclusiveness. The three outcomes of the MSNP and the outputs to which the Project is aligned are reflected in Annex 12. 48. The results-orientation and the RRNI approach, allowing for context specific interventions by communities, sets the stage for motivating and energizing communities. While the Project will benefit from the successful track record of a similar approach in various sectors and countries and from the motivation that community-driven development generates in communities, by proposing a "menu" of possible goals for each RRNI, the Project will also be focused specifically on the areas of behaviors which have been identified as those which need to change in Nepal in order to improve nutrition outcomes. Importantly, the flexibility that is built 10  Besley, Timoth. Jain, Sanjay, and Tsangarides, Charalambos. 2001. "Household participation in formal and informal institutions in rural credit markets in developing countries: evidence from Nepal". Background paper prepared for World Development Report 2001/2002.  15  into the design (i.e. communities decide how they will achieve the goals) will enable tailoring of approaches to local cultural contexts. Through incremental scaling-up over time with robust evaluation, the Project will be amenable to integrating lessons learned during the scaling-up. 49. The Project is evidence-based, building on an extensive series of analytical products prepared recently in Nepal, including evidence reviews, and on global evidence. For instance, the goals related to the reduction of indoor air pollution and smoking during pregnancy are based on evidence that indoor air pollution is associated with increased risks of low birth weight, stillbirth and reduced mean birth weight. One of the reasons of this association is that carbon monoxide reduces the capacity of blood to carry oxygen to body tissues, carbon monoxide crosses the placental barrier, hemoglobin in fetal blood has ten times more affinity to bind carbon monoxide than for adults and carbon monoxide elimination by the fetus is slower than by the mother". Similarly, insufficient weight gain during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of low birth weight, a diet consisting of predominantly staple foods is associated with increased risk of malnutrition and a better educational attainment of the mother is associated with a reduced risk of malnutrition of her children. 50. The focus of the Project is consistent with a global consensus on the importance of the "First Thousand Days" and will adopt a life-cycle approach in order to address the risk factors that are relevant to the nutritional outcomes of the first thousand days. The menu of goals has been set specifically to address the risk factors which can be reduced through community mobilization and for which the evidence of impact on nutritional status is the strongest. C. Financial Management 51. A detailed financial management assessment carried out prior to appraisal has been updated following appraisal. The Project will follow the government financial management system with some customized design due to innovativeness of the Project and learning from the good practices of other community based programs. The design of the funds flow arrangement ensures that spending at the central, district and ward levels have sufficient control mechanisms built into the system. A dedicated budget head will be created for this project to be reflected in the government's budget. The spending authority will be delegated by the Finance Secretary to the Secretary of the MOFALD who will then sub-delegate to the Joint Secretary (Project Director). The Project Director will further delegate to the project Coordinator who be accountable to prepare the detailed work program and budget for the project by coordinating both at the central and the district level. Since the project is expected to start from FY2012/13, the MOFALD will start preparing the work program and budget and discuss these with the National Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance. A Project Operations Manual will be prepared, discussed and approved by the start of the project. A core staff comprising of at least a Project Director, a Project Coordinator, a Finance Officer and a Procurement Officer will be appointed prior to the start of the project. Based on some of the initial actions and decisions by the government, a detailed financial management capacity assessment of selected districts will be carried out by the MOFALD. As an implementing agency, MOFALD is currently managing four Bank-financed projects, of which two projects - Rural Infrastructure and Decentralization Project and the Social Safety Nets Project - are required to submit audit reports. Pope et al, Epidemiol Rev, 2010;32:70-81  16  Although there are no outstanding audit reports from these projects, the audit report of the Social Safety Nets Project for FY2009/10 and FY2010/11 are not yet acceptable due to outstanding qualification related to providing opinion on expenditures incurred by the World Food Program (WFP) which constitute almost 80% of the project expenditures. This issue must be resolved before the Project is presented to the World Bank Board of Executive Directors. Based on current assessment, the financial management risk is "Substantial". D. Procurement 52. At the ward level of selected VDCs, any services or products required for the implementation of the RRNIs will be provided by the village level or district level NFSSC depending on the value of the inputs required. As far as possible, NFSSCs will obtain most of these inputs directly from various relevant agencies implementing public sector programs such as Health and Population, Education, Agricultural Development, etc. If the necessary inputs cannot be provided by the NFSSCs, the RRNI teams will obtain these from the private sector directly. The other procurement needs of the project will be related to training, production of resource materials (Operation Manual, simplified guidelines etc.) and surveys to be undertaken by the Project Management Team at MOFALD. 53. Procurement for the Project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and Non-consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the Bank in January 2011, and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the Bank in January 2011, and the provisions stipulated in the legal agreements. For each contract to be financed under the Credit/Grant, procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan for the first 18 months of the project to be developed by the Borrower and cleared by the Bank before project negotiations. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. 54. The Project does not involve much procurement and also does not include high value procurement. Most procurement activities will be carried out by the MOFALD. Procurement activities envisaged under this project include procurement of small value goods, works for repair and maintenance of physical facilities and consulting services. In order to smoothly facilitate such small value procurement at community level, MOFALD will prepare an Operations Manual containing procurement procedure/guidelines/standards/norms etc in line with the set procedure being practiced under MOFALD. Procurement of laptop computers (approx. 600 sets) required for MOFALD, DDCs and VDCs will be done at central level by the PMT to achieve economy of scale. The computers procured will be distributed to these agencies as per GoN standard procedures. Procurement of other goods including vehicles and motorbikes will also be done by the PMT. With regard to consulting services, selection of service providers (NGOs) for 15 districts and some other individual consultants will also be done at central level by the PMT. Since MOFALD is the primary implementing agency and responsible for managing overall procurement under the project to be done at district and community levels, its  17  procurement management capacity is the key for smooth project implementation. Currently MOFALD, through its separate Project Offices and Divisions/Sections, is implementing three projects (RAIDP, SSNP & HDSP), financed by the World Bank. On the basis of MOFALD's demonstrated procurement management capacity in these projects, procurement risk is currently estimated as "Substantial". The risk will be lowered, however, with the placement of a dedicated procurement officer in the PMT (financed by the project), as well as defining clear and simplified procurement procedures to be adopted under the project and regular capacity building of the staff involved in procurement management. E. Social (including Safeguards) 55. The Project triggers the OP/BP 4.10 Indigenous People (IPs) safeguard policy. OP/BP 4.10 is triggered to ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and that the indigenous people receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits. While the whole Project has been designed to benefit vulnerable groups, including the IPs, it is not exante known whether the wards where the project will be implemented coincide with those where there is a significant presence of IP groups. To ensure that any adverse effects of the Project are avoided or minimized, and these groups are able to access project benefits which are also culturally appropriate social and economic beneficial, the Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines (ESRSM) developed for the project includes measures for these vulnerable groups which will help mitigate these risks and impacts, and enhance project benefits to these groups. 56. In addition to mitigating the risks and any potential negative impact of the Project, the ESRSM guidelines also include activities, processes for public consultation and participation, monitoring mechanisms, to enhance project benefits to communities, including vulnerable groups, through the design and implementation of sub-project activities. The final guidelines have been uploaded prior to Negotiations. The guidelines will be disclosed in Nepali and English by the MOFALD, and in English at the World Bank's InfoShop. F. Environment 57. The Project is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. However, it is classified as Category B (triggering OP 4.01) because there might be occasions when the RRNI teams decide to engage in small-scale civil works such as construction or rehabilitation of latrines in schools, start fisheries, small-scale drinking water supply, construction of improved stoves, etc. However, these are envisaged to be limited in numbers, of very small scale, localized, and none of them are expected to be irreversible. The construction-related activities will also be limited to existing school buildings, health posts, etc., thus additional land for the project is not envisaged. To prevent, minimize, mitigate and improve environmental performance, the ESRSM guidelines were prepared for the project and include parameters for environmental assessment as well as land acquisition.  18  Annex 1: Results Framework and Monitoring  Country: Nepal Project Name: Community Action for Nutrition Project (Sunaula Hazar Din) (P125359) Results Framework Project Development Objectives PDO Statement The Development Objective for the Project is to improve attitudes and practices known to improve nutritional outcomes of women of reproductive age and children under the age of 2. Changes in attitudes and practices would address the key risk factors for child malnutrition and create demand for nutrition related services and products. The supply of these services and products will be provided through existing public sector and donor-funded programs, the private sector and, to a limited extent, financed through the Project.

The Project will roll out a social mobilization initiative in favor of improved nutritional outcomes through a community-driven Rapid Results for Nutrition approach where each ward will commit to a nutrition goal to be met within a 100-day period. The nutrition goals will focus on five target groups which are considered critical for improving nutrition outcomes: (i) girls and young women 15-25 years of age; (ii) pregnant women and women who want to become pregnant; (iii) children 0-6 months and their mothers; (iv) children 6-24 months; and (v) wards involved in community-wide interventions (such as hygiene, safe drinking water, sanitation, etc). This approach will be piloted during the project preparation period in 2 wards and will be rolled out under the Project in a sequenced manner across 15 districts in Nepal selected in accordance with agreed criteria, including stunting rates, population size, poverty rates and the absence of agencies that are presently working in the area of malnutrition using a similar social mobilization approach. The size of the Project is US$40 million to be implemented over a 5-year period. The Project will be implemented in the 15 districts divided in three clusters, each made of five contiguous districts. The "clustering" strategy is pursued for three reasons. First, it facilitates the transmission of best practices/innovations and creates "social proof' (i.e. stories of performance and results that motivate stakeholders). Second, it facilities the creation of a reputation for RRNI work across communities. In other countries, this has helped enroll communities into the RRNI process. Third, it lowers administrative and operational burdens. 2. Achievement of the nutrition related goals by the RRNI team would indicate a change in the attitudes and practices related to proven risk factors for malnutrition. The menu of goals does not include one specifically targeting knowledge but the achievement of the goals will require RRNI teams and communities to learn - about teenage pregnancies, child spacing, hygiene, appropriate diet during pregnancy, appropriate child feeding practices, etc. This learning is built into the approach and facilitated by the coaches. Taken together, achievement of the goals will indicate a change in attitudes and practices and directly contribute to Project's objectives as stated in the PDO and PDO indicators. 3. Component 1 (estimated US$34.86 million): Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives at the ward level. This component will finance the reasonable costs of goods, services and small works required to achieve a specific nutrition-related goal by the community. In every ward in the Project ward-level teams will be mobilized and challenged to make a change in the factors that have a negative impact on nutritional outcomes, the goals for which will be selected from a menu. These teams will compose of 5 core members (the RRNI team) and supplemented by 3-5 additional members as "agents of change", depending on the goal selected, to include Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs), members of School Management Committees, members of existing mothers groups, representatives of marginalized communities, nursing staff from health facilities, youths, etc. The RRNI team and the "agents of change" together (the RRNI Goal team) will elaborate the goal they will commit to achieve within 100 days and how they will go about achieving that goal.  22  4. The RRNI team will be mobilized by the coaches and social mobilizers recruited by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development. The purpose of the Project will be explained at the Ward Citizen Forum and the teams will be constituted according to interest and guidelines, including the participation of women and minorities, and the other targeted beneficiaries. The coaches will receive training in the RRNI approach and a training manual and facilitation notes will be produced prior to the recruitment of RRNI teams. 5. The RRNI teams will select their goal from a menu of priority goals for the achievement of improved nutritional outcomes (see Annex 7). Once the teams have chosen and, if necessary, customized the goal to fit the local situation, a simple work plan will be elaborated, stating the goal to be achieved, the target value, the way the team wants to go about achieving their goal, the way the team will ensure that the poor and marginalized will be included in the initiative, the team composition and the inputs required to succeed. 6. The work plan will be submitted to the NFSSC at the VDC level for approval for any proposal that requires financial support of less than 1,000 US$ equivalent. Work plans that require financial support over and above this level, and up to a maximum of 3,000 US$ equivalent, will be submitted to the NFSSC at the DDC level for approval. 7. The NFSSCs at the VDC and DDC levels will review the work plans and, once approved, coordinate the inputs required, if any. Required supplies will be secured through existing public or private sector services if they are available (e.g. zinc tablets for the treatment for diarrhea, together with ORS). If the work plan requires supplies which can not be secured through existing channels, the RRNI teams will procure these on their own once. These supplies will be financed under project funds (e.g. chickens for a community that wants to start chicken rearing in order to diversify their diet). The RRNI Goal team will launch their initiative once the work plan has been approved, the Grant Agreement with VDC signed and the supplies secured. This official launch will be public and involve the Ward Citizen Forum in order to create awareness, encourage community monitoring and facilitate the accountability of the teams for their achievements. 8. The coaches will keep in touch with the RRNI Goal teams on a regular basis and at midpoint, about 50 days after the launch, an assessment will be made whether the teams are on track to reach their target, facilitated by their coach. If the teams are found not to be on track to meet their goal, the work plan will be reviewed together with the coach and with the VDC and DDC, if necessary, and amended. The RRNI Goal teams will declare their achievement to the Ward Citizen Forum by the end of the 100 days, celebrate their success, if appropriate, and discuss the sustainability of the achievement. At the same time the coach will encourage the Ward Citizen Forum to take on a new challenge from the goals menu. Every ward will be encouraged to launch at least two to three RRNIs per year and simultaneous initiatives are equally encouraged, meaning that proposals need not necessarily be sequential. 9. Component 2 (estimated US$5.14 million): Project Management, Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation. This component will provide support for the implementation of Component 1 under three sub-components:  23  10. Sub-component 1: Capacity enhancement (US$1.28 million). This sub-component will finance training of the Project Management Team, the staff of regional departments and NFSSCs, as well as of coaches and social mobilizers. At the national level, support will be provided to a Project Management Team at the MOFALD. At the Regional level, support will be provided to the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP) Cluster units responsible for districts where the project will be implemented. NFSSCs at DDC and VDC level will receive training and project management support to ensure that they are able to review and process work plans and secure necessary supplies at the village level. Support to NFSSCs at DDC and VDC levels will go beyond Project specific activities and include support in coordinated planning and budgeting for nutrition relevant activities across sectors to be incorporated in the district block grants. Coaches at the VDC level will receive appropriate training and materials on the RRNI process in order to ensure high quality of work plans. The training and the development of the materials will be contracted to a consultancy firm. The Project will also support learning events for coaches on a semi-annual basis in their district where they will be able to share their experiences and to learn about successful and innovative projects. 11. Sub-component 2: Project management (US$3.38 million): This sub-component will provide the necessary inputs (consultant services, non-consultant services, goods and incremental operating costs) for effective project management at national, DDC and VDC levels. 12. Sub-component 3: Monitoring & Evaluation (US$0.48 million): This sub-component will support monitoring and evaluation of the Project, including regular collection of data on the implementation of the RRNIs, as well as data on nutritional outcomes. Third-party independent verification of results of the RRNIs will carried out. The sub-component will also finance the costs of mid-term evaluation focusing the changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices and endof-project impact evaluation focusing data collection on outcomes among the five main populations targeted under the Project. Lastly, the component will finance the costs of a Nutrition Learning Forum which will be organized annually by the National Planning Commission where results of the project will be presented and discussed and where innovative rapid results initiatives and project lessons will be highlighted. Beyond the monitoring of project activities, support will also be provided to strengthen the overall monitoring and evaluation framework for nutrition indicators and nutrition-related interventions in the districts. 13. For the evaluation of the Project a cluster-randomized design to assess the overall impacts in the areas where the study is being implemented. The Government has agreed to oversample the number of village development committees that will likely fall under the Project. Once all potential VDCs have been identified, the project team and the Government team will randomly assign VDCs to treatment and control groups. This is referred to as a clusterrandomized design. There are several levels of impact that are of interest in observing - (i) community wide program uptake, (ii) changes in attitudes and practices, and (iii) changes in specific target indicators. For example, there will be an interest in observing changes in the practice of exclusive breastfeeding or changes in smoking behavior, or the incidence of diarrhea depending upon the goals chosen by the group which will be evaluated using a difference in difference estimator. It will be important to ensure that the VDCs and wards in the sample are quite similar and norms will be used to ensure that the sampling frame provides a reasonably  24  similar cluster of wards. Since the MOFALD has already identified the most disadvantaged VDCs, it will be difficult to ensure that VDCs are not contiguous and hence there may be spillover effects. 14. Given the interest in knowledge, behavior/practices and outcomes, the evaluation will require the development of questionnaires to be targeted at different levels: VDCs, wards, and households in which the individual level information will be captured. Standardized assessments will be developed to ensure that household and individual measures of knowledge, behavior/practices and outcomes can be captured. Such surveys would have to be fielded periodically to capture the change in these indicators during the course of each 100 day RRNI interventions. 15. A single survey instrument will be developed that will applicable across a range of RRNI interventions. So in the baseline, the survey team will have to establish baselines across the entire set of indicators before knowing the specific nature of the intervention or goals that will be chosen by each ward. However, once the particular goal or set of goals has been identified and chosen, the follow-on surveys for that ward can be more narrowly focused. This will also ensure that specific target populations are accurately identified and that the households that needed to sampled will form part of the sample.  25  16.

The National Planning Commission (NPC) will provide policy guidance in accordance with its mandate to coordinate Nepal's efforts in Food and Nutrition Security. The NPC has taken the lead in the elaboration of Nepal's Multisectoral Nutrition Plan (MSNP) and has the convening power to bring all involved partners together. The coordination function by NPC is respected by all stakeholders in the area of Food and Nutrition Security and supported in this role by a number of development partners, including the World Bank through the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI), the World Food Program, UNICEF and REACH. The NPC has established a High Level Steering Committee on Food and Nutrition Security, chaired by the Vice Chairman of the NPC. As the custodian of the MSNP it will organize annual reviews of the progress in the implementation of the plan. 2. Within the MSNP, the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD) has been tasked with social mobilization in favor of improved food and nutrition security outcomes. The MOFALD will be the main implementing agency of the project in view of this role and the focus of the project. A Project Coordination Committee (PCC) will be formed, chaired by the Joint Secretary (Project Director) and will include members of the Project Management Team and representatives from the relevant line ministries. The PCC will meet regularly to assist in addressing specific issues related to policy dialogue and intersectoral coordination at the center, and inter agency coordination and performance at the project implementation levels. 3. A Project Management Team will be responsible for the day-to-day project implementation and be headed by a Project Director (Joint Secretary) and include a Project Coordinator (Under-Secretary), a Financial Management Officer who will be primarily responsible for ensuring efficient flow of funds for the project and for financial reporting to the Government and the Bank, a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, a Social Mobilization Officer, a RRNI Technical Specialist, and a Procurement Officer who will provide support to the Project Management Team in all matters related to procurement. The MOFALD has oversight of the District Councils, which endorse all of the district level development programs of the government and local bodies - District Development Committees (DDCs) and Village Development Committees (VDCs), including implementation and monitoring. Certain functions of health, agriculture and education are devolved which puts them under the purview of local bodies. Coordination and consolidation of similar programs are done by the local bodies. Social mobilization is one of the program components of the local bodies where the nutrition activities under the project will be leveraged. Furthermore, local bodies are responsible to mobilize local resources, including block grants. Among the grants that MOFALD has purview are the child cash grants that are being implemented in Karnali zone and to the children of poor dalit families throughout the country.  28  4. The RRNIs will constitute separate grants to the 15 districts for the purpose of the project to finance demand based sub-projects, relying on the established social mobilization mechanism within MOFALD's LGCDP. The implementation mechanism will focus on nutrition issues, through the involvement of NFSSCs at the district and village levels. The project will have its own flow of funds mechanism under a separate budget line item. The NFSSCs will be charged to review work plans submitted by wards and to ensure that the necessary inputs are secured. This will require NFSSCs to closely coordinate their work with the district level representatives of the relevant agencies, including Health and Population, Education and Agricultural Development. Each NFSSC at the village level will also coordinate closely with the coaches responsible for their villages to ensure that project implementation is as efficient as possible. Similarly, each coach will work closely with the existing social mobilizers and with the Ward Citizen Forums to ensure that the RRNI work plans meet the selection criteria and that the implementation of RRNIs is carried out in accordance with the Work Plan. An Operations Manual (OM) for the RRNI process will be developed and will provide all the necessary guidance and information to staff involved in implementation at all levels, from ward to the central level. The OM will also outline the responsibilities of staff at each level and the monitoring and reporting requirements. As a supplement to the Operations Manual, a simplified version of guidelines for the communities will also be prepared, which will be produced in the Nepali language. Financial Management, Disbursements and Procurement Financial Management Country Financial Management Environment Lessons Learned from other projects implemented by MOFALD Currently, the Bank has been working with the proposed implementing agency, the 5. Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD), in four other projects - Social Safety Nets Project, Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project, Emerging Towns and Social Protection Project. There is a mixed experience from the implementation of these projects from the financial management perspective. Overall, the financial management capacity is weak in the Ministry and there has always been a challenge in deputing a competent finance staff in projects. Frequent change of finance staff has often caused stress for meeting accounting and reporting challenges. In the Rural Access Project, this risk has been mitigated by supplementing the accounts staff by a consultant who supports both in maintaining the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) of the project as well as providing back-up support in the absence of finance staff. This has worked well in terms of getting the system running and submitting financial reporting on time. After the first two years struggle for a good finance staff, the MOFALD deputed a competent finance staff in the Social Safety Nets Project which ensured smooth functioning of the project. The other two projects have just entered into the portfolio but as in other cases, there is a start up delays in these projects. Getting right skilled finance staff for these continues to be a challenge. In a project under MOFALD where more focus is at the district, village and at community level, there is a need to ensure a qualified and skilled finance staff who needs to be supplemented by a national consultant to ensure better monitoring of fund  29  flow and expenditures at the field level. Therefore, this project will finance the services of accountants at the district level to mitigate this risk. Risk Analysis 6. From the financial management perspective, the overall risk is "Substantial". Given the multi-sector nature of the project which requires specialized focus on the RRNI approach, it is important to ensure the proposed governance arrangement for the implementation of the project is put in place. The Project Coordination Committee chaired by the MOFALD Joint Secretary (the Project Director) will need to play key oversight role to ensure smooth implementation of the project. In addition, a dedicated project management team which should comprise of a Project Coordinator, Finance Officer, Procurement Officer and technical specialists will need to be put in place to be accountable for project implementation. It is also important that the government will need to provide required funds to pre-finance the expenditures required for project start-up which can later be reimbursed through a retroactive financing provision. The project's Operations Manual will be prepared, defining the procedure and control measures for the RRNIs. It will also provide all necessary guidance and information to staff involved in implementation at all levels, from ward to central level. Overall, there will be strong efforts in capacity building both in technical areas as well as overall project management which include procurement and financial management. To address certain gaps that have been identified during the assessment, risk mitigation action plans have been agreed, and the risks will be reduced as the action plans get implemented. Planning and Budgeting At central level 7. The Project will follow the government financial management procedures. The budgeting procedures for preparation, approval, implementation, and monitoring are elaborated in the Financial Procedure Regulations (FPR). The annual work program and budget will be based upon the work program to be prepared by MOFALD which will be endorsed by the Project Coordination Committee. Annual work programs and budgets are submitted to the National Planning Commission (NPC) and MOF for discussion. A separate budget line will need to be created in the 'Appropriation Book' (Red Book or Budget) for FY2012/13. 8. MOF will release authorizations for expenditure to MOFALD. The Secretary of MOFALD will provide authorization for expenditure to the Joint Secretary (Project Director). The Joint Secretary will further delegate his authority to the Project Coordinator of the Project Management Team. The project funds will be managed by the Project Coordinator and the designated Finance Officer. At district level 9. The Service Providers to be recruited by the PMT will play an important role in providing coaches and for contracting out firms to conduct training for Nutrition and Food Security Steering Committees (NFSSCs) guided by the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Plan. They will  30  be assigned to work at the grassroots level. Grants will be made available at the district level to cover the operating costs of the NFSSC and the costs of RRNI proposals. RRNI proposals will be approved by the NFSSC of the VDC if the proposal is within the range of about US$1000, and for proposals between US$1000 to US$3000, it will be approved by NFSSC of the DDC.

MOF will release the budget as per the approved work program to MOFALD in three tranches as per its fund release procedures. The budget approved by GON will be indicated in the government's budget (Red Book). Prior to the approval of the annual work program and budget, one-third release of the previous year expenditures or projected expenditures for the first trimester, whichever is greater, will be made to the MOFALD through the respective DTCO. Fund release for procurement of goods and consultants will be made directly from the Designated Account which will be maintained by MOFALD and managed by the PMT. RRNI grants to be provided will be pre-financed by the government under reimbursable heading, which  31  will later be reimbursed. Fund release for other IDA's share of other expenditures which include capacity building will be pre-financed through GON's consolidated fund. 11. Upon approval of the work program and budget, appropriate adjustments will be made against the advance for the first trimester release. Subsequent second and third trimester releases are based on performance reflected by the physical progress reports as required by Schedule 2 of the FPR. At district level 12. Based on program submitted by the District Development Committees (DDCs), the MOF will provide a separate funding stream for the respective DDCs. DDCs will receive funds for project implementation (sanctioned by the concerned DTCOs) upon annual approval of the work program. DDCs will finance operating costs of NFSSC and the grants that will finance RRNI proposals based on a MOU (a format of which will be included in the OM) to be signed between the Local Development Officer (LDO) of the DDC and the RRNI Team Coordinator. VDCs will finance operating costs of NFSSCs at the village level from their budget. Consolidation of Expenditures and Reimbursement 13. For reimbursement of IDA's share of expenditures to GON's consolidated fund, a Special Designated Account will be established in US Dollars at Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) to facilitate quick payments of various activities under the project including reimbursement under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. MOFALD will designate the signatories to operate the Designated Account. The signatories on the account will be the Project Coordinator and the Finance Officer. The PMT will be responsible to consolidate all central level and district level expenditures and take action on seeking reimbursement from the World Bank. Transaction-based (traditional) disbursement procedures will be applied for withdrawal of funds. Project Financial Accounting, Reporting and Internal Controls 14. In order to ensure that project financial statements are consolidated, the Project Management Team (PMT) will ensure that separate books of accounts are maintained for the project and that accounts are prepared on a cash basis. The PMT will coordinate overall activities and work under the guidance of the Project Coordination Committee. 15. Accounting information will be regularly updated to generate timely financial reports. As required by the government system, MOFALD will maintain required ledgers including the Withdrawal Monitoring Register and Special Designated Accounts Ledger. GON's internal control system will be applied to monitor the progress of the project in accordance with sound accounting practices. The accounting systems contain the following features: (i) application of consistent cash accounting principles for documenting, recording, and reporting its financial transactions; (ii) a well-defined chart of accounts that allows meaningful summarization of financial transactions for financial reporting purposes; (iii) maintenance of withdrawal monitoring register, the record of SOEs and Designated Accounts register; (iv) the asset register;  32  (v) monthly closing and reconciliation of accounts and statements; and (vi) the production of annual financial statements. 16. The PMT will be accountable to prepare trimesterly Implementation Progress Report (IPR) and project financial statements. The project IPR will be prepared from the outset, showing the sources and uses of funds, output monitoring report, procurement management report, and narrative progress report in format to be agreed upon. To match the public sector planning and reporting cycle, the IPR will be produced on a trimester basis and submitted within 45 days from the end of the preceding trimester. Financial Management Staffing At central level 17. The Project Management Team will be the overall coordination point to coordinate the overall implementation and management of project activities. The PMT will have a qualified full-time dedicated Project Director, an Accounts Officer and a Procurement Expert or Consultant. At district level 18. The MOFALD will carry out the capacity assessment of the project districts from a fiduciary perspective and assess whether the existing accounting staff at the district level could also carry out the work load under the project or whether additional staff would be needed. In the meantime, the costs of an accountant are included in the project costs to mitigate the risk of possible substantial delays if the existing accountant staff are not able to take on the additional work under the project. Internal Audit and other assurance arrangements 19. The District Treasury Controller Office (DTCO) and the District Development Committees (DDCs) are responsible for internal audits of Project costs at MOFALD and at project districts respectively. Internal audits are carried out on a trimester basis. MOFALD has also approved guidelines for carrying out Public Audits, Public Hearings and Social Audits which will all be applied under the project. Implementation Progress Reports (IPRs) 20. Total project costs are estimated around US$40.0 million to be financed from the IDA Grant and the IDA Credit. Government counterpart contribution will be in the form of staff costs, office space and other logistics. 21. The Interim Financial Reports of the Project Implementation Progress Reports will report total investments to be separated by specific activity so that total investments as envisaged can be tracked and monitored. The PMT will separately produce from the outset the Project Implementation Progress report, showing the sources and uses of funds, output monitoring  33  report, procurement management report and narrative progress report in format to be agreed upon during negotiations. To match the public sector planning and reporting cycle, the IPR will be produced on a trimester basis and submitted within 45 days from the end of the preceding trimester. Audit 22. There are two ongoing projects implemented by the MOFALD - one for rural infrastructure and the other for social safety nets, for which audit reports are required. The other two projects have just begun and hence their audit reports are not yet due. There are no outstanding audit reports from the ongoing projects under this Ministry. There is, however, an audit issue related to Social Safety Nets Project. The audit reports of last two years (FY2009/10 and FY20 10/11) are qualified reports mainly due to non-compliance of submitting evidences of reports by World Food Program (WFP) to the MOFALD. Expenditures incurred by WFP constitute almost 80% of project expenditures, for which supplemental audit opinion is required for both fiscal years. The resolution of this issue is required prior to Board presentation. 23. The following is the audit 1 2 requirements under the Project: Annual consolidated project financial statements, SOE Statement and Designated Accounts statements will be audited by Office of Attorney General (OAG), which is considered acceptable by IDA for this purpose, and submitted to IDA within six months after the end of the fiscal year - January 15. 24. The following audit reports will be monitored in the Audit Report Compliance system (ARCS): Implementing  Audit  Auditors  Audit Due Date  Agency  MOFALD  Project Consolidated Financial Statement  OAG  6 months after the end of fiscal year (January 15t)  Financial Management Action Plan 25.

Disbursement under the Project will be made as indicated in Table C, which indicates the percentage of financing for different categories of expenditures of the project. Total project is US$40.0 million - US$22 million IDA Credit and US$18 million IDA Grant. Government counterpart contribution is in the form of staff salaries, office space and related operating costs. It is expected that IDA funds will be disbursed over a period of five years. The Closing Date of the Project is June 30, 2017.

To facilitate disbursements, a Designated Account in US Dollars will be established. Payments for project expenditures for consultant services with firms or individuals and goods will be made directly from the Designated Account by the PMT. RRNI grants, small value contracts for non-consultant services, training, and incremental operating costs will first be prefinanced by the government, and once the accounts are consolidated and approved will be transferred from the Designated Account to the government's consolidated fund. A Designated Account in US Dollars will be established at the Nepal Rastra Bank, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The ceiling for advances in Designated Account will be US$5.0 million for both credit and grant. The Designated Account will be operated under the joint signature of the  35  Project Coordinator and the Finance Officer. The PMT will ensure that the bank/cash books are reconciled with bank statements every month. Retroactive Financing 28. Retroactive financing will be provided for consulting services and operating costs effective from Aprill, 2012 and not exceeding US$ 200,000.  Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) 29. Applicable disbursement methods include: Advance, Reimbursement and Direct payment. The supporting documents for Reimbursement and Reporting uses of advances are: a) Records evidencing eligible expenditures (e.g., copies of receipts, supplier invoices) for payments against contracts that are subject to the World Bank's prior review; b) Statement of Expenditures for all other expenditures / contracts; and c) A designated account reconciliation and related bank statement for advance applications only. Detailed documentation requirements are provided in the Disbursement Letter. During the supervision, the mission will closely review SOE claims to ensure that funds are utilized for the intended purpose. Any ineligible expenditure identified during such reviews will need to be refunded to IDA. Procurement General 30. Procurement needs under the Project consist of very small value goods, works or services under Component 1 (no procurement will exceed $3,000 in value), and of consultants (individuals and firms) to provide TA to support project management, training to staff at different implementation levels under Component 2, and for assignments for carrying out surveys, evaluation and independent monitoring. Procurement under Component I shall be carried out by the RRNI teams for those products/services that cannot be directly obtained from public sector programs implemented by different Government agencies. Under Component 2, consultant services and goods will be procured by the Project Management Team at MOFALD. All procurement shall follow procedures prescribed in the national procurement law. 31. All goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit/Grant shall be procured in accordance with the requirements set forth or referred to in Section I of the "Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and Non-consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the World Bank in January 2011 ("Procurement Guidelines"), in the case of goods and non-consulting services; and Sections I and IV of the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the World Bank in January 2011 ("Consultant Guidelines") in the case of consultants' services. 32.  Particular Methods of Procurement of Goods, works and Non-consulting Services:  36  (i) Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (ii) below, goods, works and non consulting services shall be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding in accordance with the Public Procurement Act (and regulations made thereunder), subject to the following additional procedures: (a)  bid documents shall be made available, by mail or in person, to all who are willing to pay the required fee;  (b)  foreign bidders shall not be precluded from bidding and no preference of any kind shall be given to national bidders;  (c)  bids shall be opened in public in one place, immediately after the deadline for submission of bids;  (d)  qualification criteria (in case pre-qualifications were not carried out) shall be stated in the bidding documents, and if a registration process is required, a foreign firm declared as the lowest evaluated bidder shall be given a reasonable opportunity of registering, without let or hindrance;  (e)  evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the criteria disclosed in the bidding documents, in a format and specified period agreed with the Association and contracts shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders;  (f)  rebidding shall not be carried out without the prior concurrence of the Association;  (g)  extension of bid validity shall not be allowed without the prior concurrence of the Association (A) for the first request for extension if it is longer than four (4) weeks and (B) for all subsequent requests for extension irrespective of the period; and  (h)  there shall not be any restrictions on the means of delivery of the bids.  (ii) The following arrangement specifies the methods of procurement, other than National Competitive Bidding, which may be used for goods, works and non-consulting services in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's Procurement and Consultant Guidelines. The Procurement Plan shall specify the circumstances under which such methods may be used: (A) Shopping (B) Direct Contracting for items which meet the requirements of Paragraph 3.7 of the Procurement Guidelines; (C) Established Private or Commercial Practices which have been found acceptable to the World Bank and (D) Community Participation procedures which have been found acceptable to the World Bank. 33.

(ii) The following methods may be used for the procurement of consultants' services for those assignments which are specified in the Procurement Plan: (A) Quality-based Selection; (B) Selection under a Fixed Budget; (C) Least Cost Selection; (D) Selection based on  37  Consultants' Qualifications; (E) Single-source Selection; (F) Selection of Individual Consultants; and (G) Sole Source Procedures for the Selection of Individual Consultants. Review by the World Bank of Procurement Decisions 34. The Procurement Plan shall set forth those contracts which shall be subject to the World Bank's Prior Review. All other contracts shall be subject to Post Review by the World Bank. Environmentaland Social (includingsafeguards) 35. The Project triggers the OP/BP 4.10 Indigenous People (IPs) safeguard policy. OP/BP 4.10 is triggered to ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and that the indigenous people receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits. While the whole Project has been designed to benefit vulnerable groups, including the IPs, it is not exante known whether the wards where the project will be implemented coincide with those where there is a significant presence of IP groups. To ensure that any adverse effects of the Project are avoided or minimized, and these groups are able to access project benefits which are also culturally appropriate social and economic beneficial, the Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines (ESRSM) developed for the project includes measures for these vulnerable groups which will help mitigate these risks and impacts, and enhance project benefits to these groups. 36. In addition to mitigating the risks and any potential negative impact of the Project, the ESRSM guidelines also include activities, processes for public consultation and participation, monitoring mechanisms, to enhance project benefits to communities, including vulnerable groups, through the design and implementation of sub-project activities. The draft guidelines were uploaded on MOFALD's website prior to project appraisal and the final guidelines were uploaded prior to Negotiations. The guidelines will be disclosed in Nepali and English by the MOFALD, and in English at the World Bank's InfoShop. 37. The Project is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. However, it is classified as Category B (triggering OP 4.01) because there might be occasions when the RRNI teams decide to engage in small-scale civil works such as construction or rehabilitation of latrines in schools, start fisheries, small-scale drinking water supply, construction of improved stoves, etc. However, these are envisaged to be limited in numbers, of very small scale, localized, and none of them are expected to be irreversible. The construction-related activities will also be limited to existing school buildings, health posts, etc., thus additional land for the project is not envisaged. To prevent, minimize, mitigate and improve environmental performance, the ESRSM guidelines were prepared for the project and include parameters for environmental assessment as well as land acquisition. Monitoring& Evaluation 38. Monitoring of the project will entail activities that will empower communities and ensure greater transparency, accountability and inclusion. The monitoring indicators will be obtained  38  from surveys and from routine data on physical and financial outputs. There will also be a third party monitoring conducted by contracted civil society organizations and supervision missions. 39. Before the implementation of the Project, a baseline survey will be done to assess the attitudes and practices in the above domains in each project district. The survey will also generate baseline data on the impact level indicators including the percentage of stunted children 0-24 months of age and the prevalence of anemia in pregnant women as a baseline. There will be a similar survey conducted to evaluate the Project's progress in achieving its objectives and anticipated impact 4 months before the Closing Date. 40. To monitor the Project during implementation, a limited number of intermediate results indicators are chosen to assess the progress of the project. The Project is designed to promote the implementation of multiple Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives (RRNIs) within any given ward in multiple villages in the targeted districts. The intermediate results indicators that will measure the progress is the number of RRNIs carried out "successfully". 41. At the community level, since people are empowered to implement their own action plans to achieve goals, the team members will monitor their activities in a participatory method by producing a chart of their completed actions and financial costs incurred for inputs. In order to ensure transparency, the RR teams will hold meetings for the community people, one during the mid phase and another during the end of each RRNI, to disclose the physical progress and financial status of the RRNIs. Upon completion of RRNIs, the communities will submit RRNI completion reports which will include an assessment of progress (goals achieved against the target set by the team) and financial expenditures. The reports will be first discussed publicly at community level, facilitated by the Village Development Committee (VDC), amended if necessary, and subsequently submitted to the NFSSCs and the District Development Committees (DDCs). 42. The coaches of the RRNI teams will help build the capacity of the communities to monitor their own activities during the pre-launch workshops and by holding regular consultations with the team. At the RRNIs level at the communities, the monitoring parameters will be kept as simple as possible. 43. At the national level, since the MOFALD is the monitoring agency, it will oversee that the coaches are proactive/entrepreneurial and receive appropriate training and supporting materials to help them assist RRIs work at the wards. In order to ensure quality assurance of the RRNI coaches, each DDC will hold monthly meetings with the coaches and make regular field visits to monitor their work. The quality of coaches will be assessed by measuring the percentage of "successful" RRNIs implemented under their guidance and by their effort to motivate the communities to implement new waves of RRNIs. 44. Since MOFALD is an implementing agency and will also be contracting out services to provide and train coaches for the RRIs, validation of data by a third party source will be used to measure progress of the project against the proposed intermediate results indicators and verify the reports on the performance of the coaches. The frequency of the third party independent  39  verification of results will be yearly and will cover all the categories on a sample basis from each district. 45. After completion of RRNIs, communities are given a 7-days period consolidated reports of completion (including financial and technical information). be presented at end end-of-RRNI workshop with the participation of the coaches and NFSSCs at the VDC level.

World Bank for review.  to submit These will the staff of The DDC submit the  46. The Project will be evaluated at two periods during implementation- one at the mid-term and another at the end of the project. The physical progress will be evaluated against the targeted intermediate results set forth in the results matrix, against the targeted attitudes and practices for each domain at district levels. Data for the intermediate results are collected by the DDCs and then combined by the MOFALD at the central level. The two surveys (mid-term and end-of Project) that are planned will be used to measure attitudes and practices for each domain and the outcome level indicators. 47. Beyond the monitoring of Project activities, support will also be provided to strengthen the overall Monitoring and Evaluation framework for nutrition indicators and nutrition-related interventions in the districts. Through the support to NFSSCs nutrition related information from the health sector, the education sector, the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works and Planning, the Ministry of Agricultural Development and the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development will be linked with the District Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System (DPMAS) at district level and with the Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System (PMAS) at central level. Arrangements for results monitoring 48. The MOFALD will be responsible for the implementation of the monitoring and evaluation process, specifying the roles, responsibilities and institutional arrangements. 49. The MOFALD will ensure good governance and accountability by regular and timely disclosure of activities related to the project including program budgets, contracts and procurement, audit issues and actions taken to address them. The disclosure will be made on the MOFALD websites and by notices at the district levels. 50. Besides the reports on physical progress and financial management, the MOFALD will also report on the obstacles encountered, opportunities foreseen and suggestions to improve the implementation of RRIs during the annual and mid-term reviews. This will be done by holding a workshop at the central level by involving key stakeholders of the RRIs. The end of Project evaluation will be conducted during the last six months of the project.  40  Annex 4: Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) NEPAL: Sunaula Hazar Din - Community Action for Nutrition Project  Stage: Appraisal  1.1 Stakeholder Risk  Rating  Description:  Risk Management:  (i) Change of policy direction in addressing under-nutrition.

The implementation support plan for the Project has been developed based on the specific nature of the project activities, lessons learned from past operations in the country and sector, and the project's risk profile in accordance with the Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF). The plan will be reviewed regularly and revised as and when required. 2. The plan includes thorough and frequent review of implementation performance and progress. The Bank team will monitor progress on the following, inter alia: (i) key performance indicators as identified in the Results Framework; (ii) progress against the agreed activities and targets set out in the project procurement plan and the implementation plan; (iii) performance of RR teams with respect to their identified goals; (iv) the responsiveness of district and village NFSSCs in providing key supplies, as per approved work plans; (v) key legal conditions and covenants; and (vi) whether sufficient funds are available in the project for the selected communities to carry out RRNIs, as planned. Information from various sources will be used to assess and monitor progress of the Project throughout its implementation. The Bank will also review the findings and results of third party assessments, surveys and social audits which will be undertaken during the course of Project implementation. In addition to formal implementation support missions and field visits, which will be carried out semi-annually, the Bank team will participate in the annual conference organized by the National Planning Commission where findings and innovations from the RRNIs will be presented. 3. The Bank fiduciary specialists based in the country office will provide timely and effective support to the client. In addition to carrying out an annual ex-post review of procurement that falls below the prior review thresholds, the procurement specialist will lead thematic and focused missions depending on the procurement needs and as agreed with Government. The FM team will also provide capacity building efforts that include organizing periodic financial management clinics and coaching to the Project staff. In addition to ex-post review of the financial management system, the team will also review all financial management reports included in the trimester implementation progress reports and annual audit reports and take necessary follow-up actions as per Bank procedures. These team members will also help identify capacity building needs to strengthen fiduciary management. Safeguard specialists will also be involved in supervision throughout the Project to ensure the monitoring of implementation of agreed plans.

The project's macroeconomic context 1. Public expenditure is growing in recent years while concerns about its quality remain. Despite slow growth in revenue, expenditure remains high. At the same time, reports from the Public Accounts Committee shows an increase of 42 percent in outstanding audit irregularities in FY11 compared to previous year. Poor public finance management manifested in weak internal control system, non-compliance with prevailing law and breakdown of internal controls, and weak accountability are all worrisome signs. The country is going through a transition and the rate of turnover of government officials is high. In the past few years alone various coalition of political parties formed government only to be replaced by another coalition after several months. As such political stability remains elusive and such an environment can easily feed into increased public spending and weak accountability. 2. The project is likely to improve the quality of public spending in a number of ways. First, as the Project aims to generate demand for social services, the efficiency of public expenditure on these services can improve. Second, through demand creation, the project enhances the accountability of service providers at the community level. Accountability at the community level is essential in the current political environment where political instability has created an atmosphere which presents challenges to efforts to promote accountability at a higher level to improve quality of public spending. 3. The project is likely to improve the quality of public spending in a number of ways. First, as the Project aims to generate demand for social services, the efficiency of public expenditure on these services improves. Second, through demand creation, the project enhances the accountability of service providers at the community level. Accountability at the community level is essential in the current political environment where political instability has created an atmosphere not suitable for promoting accountability at a higher level resulting in poor quality of public spending. 4. The fiscal impact of the project is likely to be limited. The Project may reduce wastage by generating demand for excess capacity, but in the absence of excess capacity, it may also result in increased public spending on social services. Demand for such services is expected to increase due to the Project. If there were excess capacity, then this capacity will be utilized, hence improving efficiency of public spending. However, when the supply is not enough to accommodate the increase in demand, then there will be pressures to increase public spending on these services. As such, given the budget available excess capacity in the supply of these services and the rate of budget absorption, the fiscal impact of the Project is likely to be limited. 5. The project's impact on distribution is clear in that it benefits the poor, children and women. The target beneficiaries in specific populations are relevant to achieving the PDO including girls and young women between 15 and 25 years of age, pregnant women and women who want to become pregnant in the next 6 months, children below 24 months of age and their  52  caretakers. Geographically also, the Project will benefit the poorest VDCs in 15 districts selected on the basis of poverty levels, nutritional status, and the absence of similar interventions by other partners.  B. Sectoral Spending levels and trends 6. There has been an increase in social services spending over the last ten years. Spending rose to 11.7 percent of GDP in 2010 from 5.4 in 2001. As such, it represents doubling of spending on social services within a decade. This includes an increase in spending in rural infrastructure, safety net programs, and grants to local governments which mostly benefits education, health water and sanitation programs. Spending on drinking water and sanitation has been increasing but still remains less than 1 percent of GDP (Figure 1). In line with the policy of expanding access to drinking water, an average 67 percent of the sector's spending goes to rural and community-managed drinking-water activities. Spending in the education sector has been increasing, and at 4.1 percent of GDP remains the largest of all social sectors. More than onehalf of the education sector's spending goes toward primary education, with more teacher deployment and scholarships to underserved regions. Spending in health also has increased substantially in the past ten years, reaching 1.4 percent of GDP in 2010 from 0.83 percent in 2001. More than three quarters of public spending in health goes into services that are preventive in nature and assists in increasing immunization coverage, contraceptive use, and improving nutrition ultimately reducing maternal, child and infant mortality rates. 7. Expenditures in the social sectors are becoming increasingly pro-poor Expenditure in education is the most pro-poor at 14.07 percent of total expenditure in 2010 followed by local development at 6.38 percent and health at 4.95 percent. Although expenditures in local development and health are catching up with education, with an increase of pro-poor expenditure in local development by 72 percent and health more than 48 percent between 2003 and 2010. During the same period, the increase in pro-poor expenditure in education was only 3.7 percent.  4.5 4  o3.5 2K-Education  S2.5 --  Health  S1.5  --  Water and Sanitation  1  --  Local Development  2  0.  _  0.5  0 C0  rHC1 0  Cn 0  ZJ 0  0  W 0  h0  00 0  al1 0  0 -  CN  q  CN  CN  Nq  Nq  CN  Nq  Nq  CN  Year Figure 1.

Given the budget utilization rate, the Project is unlikely to push public expenditure in these sectors higher than its current level but has the potential to improve efficiency. The increase in demand due through the project can be accommodated through existing level of 13 spending. As noted in the recent public expenditure review , the key issue in these sectors in effective implementation. Improving implementation is cited as the main potential source of efficiency gains. At the same time, budget execution in these sectors remains well below the allocated amount and there is significant potential to increase supply with the current budget allocation.  C. Why invest in nutrition and why involve public sector? 9. Why invest? There a growing body of evidence that demonstrates the rational for investing in nutrition, especially in developing countries such as Nepal. 10. Nutritional interventions contribute significantly to the reduction of child and maternal mortality and physical and cognitive damages. Millions of mothers and children die globally and millions more are permanently disabled by mental and physical defects due to underlying causes of malnutrition and poor dietary intake early in life. The costs of irreversible physical and cognitive damage that children face due to under nourishment by 24 months of age are very large. The impact of such damage is has a strong intergenerational component. 11. At the same time, there are known and available effective interventions to reduce underweight, stunting, micronutrient deficiencies, and child deaths in Nepal. Recent analytical work commissioned by the Bank 1 4 has reviewed the evidence for essential nutrition intervention and provided the evidence base on what works for Nepal. Among those interventions reviewed, breastfeeding counseling, appropriate complementary feeding, and vitamin A and zinc supplementation were identified as having the greatest potential to reduce child deaths and the future disease burden related to malnutrition. 12. Investment in these interventions will contribute to reducing maternal and child mortality and reducing poverty by enhancing productivity, cognitive development, and school performance. There is a large body of evidence showing the link between income/eaming and nutritional status. At the macroeconomic level, malnutrition could result a significant loss of national income. In countries with high levels of anemia, for instance, it is estimated to cause about a 2% reduction in GDP15 . At the household level, malnutrition causes a significant reduction in earning: a study in Brazil found that a percentage decrease in adult height could 16 result in up to 4% reduction in earnings . More importantly, improved nutrition will reduce maternal and child mortality. 13World Bank. 2010.

Nutritional interventions are found to be among the most cost-effective interventions to enhance welfare globally. In the Copenhagen Consensus 2008, a panel of renowned economists, ranked five nutritional interventions among ten of thirty proposals presented to answer the question of the best way to advance global welfare. It ranked micro nutrient supplements for children including vitamin A and zinc supplementation first, micro nutrient fortification including iron and salt iodization third, de-worming and other nutrition programs at school sixth and community based nutrition promotion as ninth. The ranking takes into account the benefit cost ratio, feasibility and sustainability of the interventions. 14. But why involve the public sector in Nepal? Even when investment in nutrition is worth making, there needs to be well argued case for public involvement in those investments. From an economics perspective, a case has to be made either from a market failure or from an equity/poverty reduction perspective to justify public involvement and hence the project. In Nepal there is sound case for public involvement as described below: Information 'asymmetry' and externality: people do not always have full information on feeding practice and food that is best for their children and themselves. Because growth faltering may be the norm, and micronutrient deficiencies are not typically visible enough to be easily recognized, they are often even unaware of the need to invest in improving the nutritional status of their children. The role of information is even more critical because of the limited window of opportunity where the highest impact on nutrition could be made. The benefit of improved nutrition accrues not only to the individual making the investment but to the society at large as improved nutrition reduces the impact of disease and improves productivity. An absence of internalization of all the benefits of one's investments results in underinvestment in nutrition relative to that which is socially desirable. 60 50  0 ** Poorest ***g** Poorer Middle  30  20  ***X** Richer  .. *  **.)K Richest  10  -  TotalI  0 1996  2001  2006  2011  Figure 2. Prevalence of Moderate Stunting by Wealth Index, Children 6-24 months of age - 1996-2011 Source: Preliminary result from "thematic report on food security and nutrition. The report uses NLSS III.  Equity and poverty: there are two equity considerations that justify public investment in nutrition in Nepal. First, the burden on malnutrition falls on the poor disproportionately.  55  Table_1 shows the prevalence of severe and moderate stunting for children aged 60 months and under in 2011. Malnutrition is concentrated among the rural residents, households with illiterate women and the poorest. Moreover, the trend shows that while malnutrition has declined nationally, this reduction is concentrated among the richest households. If anything, malnutrition has increase among poor households (Figure 2). Hence, the fact that the poor are disproportionately affected by malnutrition is a good reason for public intervention. Furthermore, it is well established in the literature which looks at the nutrition- poverty nexus that the poor are trapped in a low income-low nutrition equilibrium and public intervention is essential to breaking this vicious cycle. Second, in an economy where access to credit is limited, the opportunity to transfer assets across time is limited especially for the poor. This is true for Nepal (see Besley, Jain and Tsangarides, 2001)." Although the returns to investments in nutrition are high and are common knowledge, such high return investments are beyond the reach of the poor due to credit constraints that the poor face.  17 Besley, Timoth.

The report uses NLSS III data.  D. Valuation of the project 15. The success of the project is measured by the extent to which it creates demand for nutrition related services. The impact on nutritional status, however, depends on both the generated demand for nutritional related services and the responsiveness of the supply to the increase in demand. It is envisaged that the supply response will be supported mainly by ongoing projects and programs in the various sectors including health, education, safety nets, and rural development. This complicates the economic and financial analysis of the project as it requires a counterfactual world that represents the situation in the absence of the project. Fortunately, the impact evaluation planned under the project enables such exercise to be carried out. The impact evaluation will provide rigorous results to undertake a cost effectiveness analysis. The planned impact evaluation provides a rare opportunity to undertake an economic evaluation on the size of impacts that is less affected by estimation problems, unobserved heterogeneity and at times endogeneity that most non-experimental studies suffer from.  57  16. Few studies have been done on the cost and benefit of nutritional interventions. The benefits and costs vary by country and are context dependent in a sense that they depend on the state of the economy, relative prices, the health status and other environments. Yet, global estimates presented in Table 2 provide some broad insight to benefits and costs of investments in nutrition. Table 2. Costs and Benefits of selected nutritional interventions, range of global estimates. Interventions Benefits Costs Benefits/cost Breastfeeding promotion in hospitals $5952-8929 $133-1064 5.6-67.1 Integrated child care programs $376-653 $40 9.4-16.2 Iodine (per child bearing age) $75-130 $0.25-5 15-520 Iron (pregnant women) $82-140 $10-13.4 6.1-14 Note: Both benefits and costs are in USD ; discount rate = 3-5%; One can relax the assumption of valuing life from earnings to a fixed amount of say $100,000 so that all life saved whether in poor or rich countries is valued equally. This certainly increases the benefit cost ratio of the interventions dramatically. It changes the benefit cost ration of the breastfeeding promotion to the range of 108-939.8, of Iodine to the range of 622.6-13388; of Iron to the range of 636.9-952.3.

The immediate causes of chronic malnutrition in Nepal include poor feeding and acre practices, insufficient nutrient intake, high rate of infection and teenage pregnancy. Less than half(44.5%) of babies are initiated with breastfeeding though 70% are exclusively breastfed at 6 months, only 65% are introduced to complementary foods after 6 months; most importantly complementary feeding is infrequent, and inadequate in terms of quality, quantity and safety. Only one-fourth of the children (DHS, 2011) are fed with the recommended IYCF practices (4+ food group and minimum mean frequency). A quarter of mothers give birth before the age of eighteen. Then, they are often involved in heavy workload including farming immediately after delivery, plus a quarter of them smoke that account for 30% low birth weight in 2006, while less than a quarter were provided with any quality animal protein food or foods made with oil or fat the day before (DHS, 2006). Maternal and infant infections are very common; intestinal parasites constitute 18 Extracted from: MSNP Policy Brief, The National Planning Commission, 2012  61  one of the major public health problems; prevalence of fevers (19%) are as common as diarrheal diseases (14%) while ARI is affecting 5% of children , all causing young children's deaths and  malnourishment (DHS, 2011). With regards to the underlying causes of chronic malnutrition, ensuring food security for an estimated 3.5 million (Initiative on Soaring Food Prices- FAO) of the population in food deficit areas throughout the year is an uphill task. There is still a wide gap in sanitation services with half the population still defecating in the open. About half of the population lives in single roomed dwellings with a mud floor and an open fire for cooking and heating. Regarding the basic causes, there is increasing inequity. Some of the discriminatory and exclusionary practices based on gender, caste, class, religion, ethnicity or regions persist but development actors and agencies have significantly improved their orientation on social inclusion and gender in recent years. The longer-term vision of the multi-sectoral nutrition plan, over the next ten years, is to embark the county towards significantly reducing chronic malnutrition to ensure that it is no longer becomes an impeding factor to enhance human capital and for overall socio-economic development. The goal over t he next five years, is to improve maternal and child nutrition which will result in the reduction of Maternal Infant and Young Child (MIYC) under-nutrition , in terms of maternal BMI and child stunting, by one third. The main purpose is to strengthen capacity of the NPC and the key Ministries to promote and steer the multi-sectoral nutrition program for improved maternal and child nutrition at all key levels of society. MSNP will contribute towards attaining its long-term vision and mid-term goal by achieving three major outcomes: Outcome 1: Policies, Plans and muti-sectoral coordination improved at national and local levels. Outcome 2: Practices that promote optimal use of nutrition "specific" and nutrition" sensitive" services improved, leading to enhanced maternal and child nutritional status. Outcome 3: Strengthened capacity of central and local governments on nutrition to provide basic services in an inclusive and equitable manner. The plan focuses on the narrow window of growth falter, with an urgent set of essential interventions, and will complement other relevant sectoral policies and strategies, such as the health sector's National Nutrition Policy and Strategy (2004) and agriculture sectors upcoming Food and Nutrition Security Plan (FNSP) as part of Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS). The MNSP has identified eight outputs (results): Output 1: Policies and plans updated/ reviewed to incorporate a core set of nutrition specific indicators at national and sub- national levels. NPC and sector ministries will be responsible to attain this result. Output 2: Multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms functional at national and sub-national levels. NPC and local bodies will be responsible to attain this result.  62  Output 3: Maternal and child nutritional care service utilization improved, especially among the unreached and poor segment of the society. The health sector will be responsible to attain this result. Output 4: Adolescent girl's parental education, life skills and nutrition status enhanced. The education sector will be responsible to attain this result. Output 5: Diarrheal diseases and ARI episodes reduced among young mothers, adolescent girl's infants and young children. The physical planning and works sector will be responsible to attain this result. Output 6: Availability and consumption of appropriate foods (in terms of quality, quantity, frequency and safety) enhanced and women's workload reduced. The agriculture, environment and local development sectors will be responsible to attain this result. Output 7: Capacity of national and sub-nationals levels enhanced to provide appropriate support to improve maternal and child nutrition. NPC, health, education physical planning and works, agriculture, and local development sectors will be responsible to attain this result. Output 8: Multi-sectoral nutrition information updated and linked both at national and subnational levels. NPC, health, education physical planning and works, agriculture, and local development sectors will be responsible to attain this result.  63  Annex 13: Statement of Loans and Credits NEPAL: Sunaula Hazar Din - Community Action for Nutrition Project Active Projects  Difference Between Expected and Actual Original Amount inUS$ Millions  Disbursements  Project ID Fiscal Year Project Name  IBRD  IDA  SF  GEF  P120265 P104015 P099296 P112893 P105860 P110762 P043311 P118179 P095977 P083923 P071285 P113441 P090967 P117417 P113002 P087140  0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00  25.00 50.00 64.30 38.00 192.50 50.00 164.80 43.00 117.60 77.00 52.30 130.00 60.00 129.15 64.47 20.00 1278.12  0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00  0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00  2011 2011 2008 2011 2008 2008 2003 2012 2008 2005 2004 2010 2007 2010 2009 2009  Emerging Towns Project Enhanced Vocational Educ & Trng Irrig & Water Res Mgmt Project Kabeli Transmission Project PAF II Peace Support Project Power Delopment Project Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project Road Sector Delopment Project Rural Access Improve. & Decentralization Rural Water Supply & Sanitation Project School Sector Reform Program Second Higher Education Project Second HNP and HIV/AIDS Project Social Safety Nets Project Agriculture Commercialization & Trade Total:  Cancel.

No  Public Disclosure Copy  2. Project Objectives The Development Objective for the Project is to improve attitudes and practices known to improve nutritional outcomes of women of reproductive age and children under the age of 2. Changes in attitudes and practices would address the key risk factors for child malnutrition and create demand for nutrition related services and products. The supply of these services and products will be provided through existing public sector and donor-funded programs, the private sector and, to a limited extent, financed through the Project. 3. Project Description The Project will roll out a social mobilization initiative through a community-driven “Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiative” (RRNI) where each ward in a selected VDC will commit to a series of pre-defined nutrition relevant goals, each to be met within a 100-day period. The achievement of the goals will be the responsibility of Rapid Results (RR) teams, one for each ward, supported by a coach who will support all RR teams in one VDC. The Rapid Results approach will be introduced early in a few wards, before Project Effectiveness, to inform details to be included in the Operational Manual. It will then be rolled out under the proposed Project in a sequenced manner across 15 districts in the country. These districts have been selected on the basis of a) stunting levels; b) population size; c) poverty levels; and d) the absence of interventions by other partners that focus on social mobilization for improved nutrition outcomes. Within selected districts, VDCs will be selected on the basis of poverty indicators, with an estimated 25% of VDCs (900 – 1000) participating in the project given the project’s financial envelope. Component 1 (estimated US$34.93 million): Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives at the ward level. This component will support the entire Rapid Results process. It will start at a Ward Citizen Forum where key nutrition challenges of the community will be discussed. Assisted by a coach at the ward level, the ward will select a nutrition relevant goal from a menu of goals. A Rapid Results (RR) team would be selected at the ward level that will set an appropriate and realistic target for meeting the goal and pledge to achieve the goal within a 100-day period by mobilizing the community and finding the best approach to achieving the target in their particular context. The RR team will prepare a Work Plan which will outline the needed inputs to achieve the goal. The Work Plan will be submitted for review to the Nutrition and Food Security Steering Committees (NFSSC) at the VDC level if the total value is below US$1,000 equivalent and to the NFSSC at the district level if the total value is between US$1,000 and the maximum of US$3,000 equivalent. There will be a mid-term assessment by the RRNI team with assistance from the coach and an end-of the 100 days initiative evaluation by the team of whether it was able to meet the goal and a presentation of the results to the Ward Citizen Forum. At the same occasion, the RR team will account for the use of inputs, financial or otherwise, and the end-of the 100 days initiative evaluation will effectively serve as a public audit of the initiative as well. Modalities for sustaining and expanding the achievement will be an important topic during the evaluation of the 100 days initiative. Component 2 (estimated US$5.07 million): Project Management, Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation. This component will provide support for the implementation of Component 1 by (i) building the necessary capacity of staff involved at all levels of project implementation; (ii) providing necessary inputs for effective project management; and (iii) ensuring monitoring and evaluation of the Project, including the evaluation of the Rapid Results process as well as whether the expected outcomes of the Rapid Results initiatives were achieved.  Page 1 of 4  Public Disclosure Copy  At the National level, support will be provided by a Project Management Team at the Ministry of Local Development (MOLD) to ensure effective management of the project. At the Regional level, support will be provided to the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP) Cluster units responsible for districts where the Project will be implemented. At the district level, support will be provided by the NFSSCs which will be responsible for reviewing RRNI Work Plans and coordinating the supply of necessary inputs for the RRNIs. Similarly, NFSSCs at the level of VDCs will receive training and project management support to ensure that they are able to review and process work plans and secure necessary supplies at the village level. Support to NFSSCs at district and VDC levels would go beyond Project specific activities and include support in coordinated planning and budgeting for nutrition relevant activities across sectors to be incorporated in the district block grants. Support for the Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project will include regular collection of data on the implementation of the Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives, data on the behaviors and practices which the RRNIs are expected to change, as well as data on the nutritional outcomes. The component will finance the costs of a mid-term evaluation focusing on the changes in attitudes and practices and an end-of-Project impact evaluation focusing on outcomes among the five main populations targeted under the Project. The component will also include a third-party independent verification of results of the RRNIs. On an annual basis, there will als o be a Nutrition Learning Forum organized by the National Planning Commission where results of the project will be presented and discussed, where innovative RRNIs and project lessons would be highlighted and where selected communities would be honored for their special achievements. 4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) Project interventions will be supported in 15 districts, selected on the basis of: (a) stunting levels; (b) population size; (c) poverty levels; and (d) the absence of interventions by other partners that focus on social mobilization. The project districts are in the central Terai: Parsa, Bara, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari, and Dhanusa; in the Central Hills: Dhading, Nuwakot, Makwanpur, Sindhuli and Ramechhap; in the Eastern Terai: Siraha, Saptari, and Sunsari; in the Eastern Hills: Udayapur. These districts, selected on the basis of poverty and health indicators, are spread throughout the country and do not possess any physical characteristics that would be particularly relevant for safeguard analysis. Similarly, no large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are expected. Therefore, the project is expected to be Category B. The main environmental and social safeguards policies to be triggered under this project are: OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP/ BP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples to ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and that the indigenous people receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits. 5.

The nutritional status of Janajatis is more likely to be compromised because of social, geographic and economic barriers.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: This project is classified as Category B because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. There might be occasions when the RR team decides to engage in small-scale civil works such as construction or rehabilitation of latrines in schools, start fisheries, smallscale drinking water supply, construction of improved stoves, etc. However, these are envisaged to be limited in numbers, of very small scale, localized, and none are expected to have irreversible impacts. To prevent, minimize, mitigate and improve environmental performance, ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’ is prepared for each of the sub-projects envisaged under the project which includes parameters for environmental assessment. The construction-related activities will also be limited mostly to existing school buildings, health posts, etc., thus the purchasing of additional Page 2 of 4  Public Disclosure Copy  land for the project is not envisaged. Any additional land required under the Project will be voluntarily donated. The 'Environmental and Social Management Framework' includes provisions assuring that any voluntary land donation is adequately recorded and a verification mechanism is in place to monitor (and report) any violation of commitment by the government to only use voluntary land donation. The project triggers OP/BP 4.10 on Indigenous People (IP). While the whole project has been designed to benefit vulnerable groups, including the IPs, it is not ex-ante whether the wards where the program will be implemented coincide with those where there is a significant presence of IP groups. To ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and these groups are able to access project benefits which are also culturally appropriate social and economic beneficial, the ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’ developed for the project includes measures for these vulnerable groups and women which will help mitigate these risks and impacts, and enhance project benefits to these groups. 2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: There are no expected indirect and/or long-term impacts of the project. 3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. Given the nature of this project, only small scale infrastructure works, if any, are being considered. Further, the project addresses some key equity issues directly in the project components, implementation arrangements and results framework. Thus, no overall project level alternatives were considered. 4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. To ensure that any adverse social and environmental impacts are avoided or minimized, an 'Environmental and Social Management Framework' has been prepared for the project which include measures to mitigate the risks and impacts of the project, and also incorporates activities and processes for public consultation and participation, monitoring mechanisms, grievance redress, and measures to enhance project benefits to communities, including vulnerable groups, through the design and implementation of sub-project activities. For each of the 11 possible sub-projects envisaged under the project, ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’ are also prepared which include parameters for environmental assessment and vulnerable communities (including IPs), and also measures to mitigate the environmental and social risks and impacts of the sub-project activities. The implementing agency, the Ministry of Local Development (MOLD) has extensive experience in implementing Bank-led projects. Further, at the regional level, the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP) cluster units that is responsible for districts where the project will be implemented, has been planning and implementing the Asian Development Bank’s safeguard policies, which are closely aligned with those of the World Bank. However, depending on the expertise available within the Project Management team at the MOLD set up for this project, and the coaches and RR teams at the local levels that will be responsible for incorporating safeguards measures in the work plans for the sub-projects, orientation trainings might be required for the team.  Public Disclosure Copy  5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. The 'Environmental and Social Management Framework' developed for the project and the ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’ for the sub-projects will be shared by the Ministry of Local Development with all concerned institutions, government agencies, and civil society organizations at the national, regional and local levels. Further, at the local level, consultations will be held at the Ward Citizen Forum, and the Rapid Results (RR) team selected at the ward level will incorporate relevant elements/aspects from the framework and the guidelines while setting up targets and preparing a work plan for attaining the nutritional outcomes, mobilizing the community, and monitoring and evaluating results. The draft 'Environmental and Social Management Framework' and the ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’ will be uploaded on MOLD’s website prior to April 20, 2012, to invite comments from relevant stakeholders. The final guidelines will be uploaded prior to negotiations. The framework and the guidelines will be disclosed in Nepali and English by the MOLD, and in English at the World Bank’s InfoShop. B.

 Background   The Government of Nepal (GON) is committed to bringing about tangible changes in the local governance and community development process. The aim is to improve the living standards of the people through community led development, efficient service delivery, good governance, based on a democratic value system and rights-based approach and inclusive development efforts subsequent to the restructuring of the state. This will be based on the conceptual framework of federal, inclusive and participatory development, with the implementation of local level development initiatives under the leadership of local autonomous government. The focus of the local development programme will be to support poverty alleviation measures based on the fundamental premises of inclusive development, and through the mobilisation of local resources and use of local skills and technology opportunities – all with the direct involvement of local citizens and community organisations. At present, a major task of the GON is to substantiate the objectives, policies and principles of the Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA), 2055 and to translate the principles of local self-governance into practice through the mobilisation of local bodies and local communities with the facilitation and support of the central line ministries. The LSGA provides the legal basis for the involvement of civil society organisations (CSO) in formulating plans for the local bodies. A shared commitment to work together for this purpose exists between the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) and the Development Partners (DPs). Given the need of improving local governance and participatory approaches to establish robust accountability of local government to communities, the current political scenarios and the earlier tendency of DPs to pursue their own priorities with discrete programmes in separate geographic areas, this convergence is a major achievement. Now, the need to bring the private and NGO sectors into the planning and implementation process and to enable better engagement of local communities in the local governance reform process to ensure that services are responsive to their needs, has been recognised. MLD’s vision on local governance and community development is to bring improvement in the living standard of the masses through local good governance based on a democratic value system and inclusive development effort subsequent to the restructuring of the state, based on the conceptual framework of federal, inclusive and participatory development, with the execution of the local level development initiatives under the leadership of local autonomous government. A number of development partners have signed a letter of intent to provide programme support within the areas of local governance and community development. Some development partners intend to provide further support over a longer period of time. Although government structures and systems are likely to change over the coming years, LGCDP will be the first phase of a longer term programme of support to local governance and community development strengthening both the demand and the supply sides of local service delivery and good governance to attain the LSGA spirit. The programme strongly supports MLD’s vision of local development and self-governance to bring good governance and development interventions to the people by maintaining fiscal discipline, correcting mismanagement, delays and non-transparent procedures. This programme will be the national programme framework for achieving improvements in the system of local governance and community development. The underlying intention of the LGCDP is to move 7  the local governance and community development sector towards a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) for decentralisation.  1.2   The New Nepal   The peace process started in June 2006, with the signing of the eight-point agreement between the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) and the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) Maoist. The comprehensive peace agreement, concluded between the GON and the CPN (Maoist) in November 2006 guaranteed a political system based on universally accepted fundamental human rights, a competitive multiparty democratic system, constitutional checks and balances, independent judiciary, periodic elections, participation by civil society, press freedom, people’s right to information, transparency and accountability in the activities of political parties, peoples’ participation and the concepts of impartial, competent, and fair administration. The Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007) reflects the commitments made by the SPA and the CPN (Maoist) and sets the future direction for the social, political and economic transformation of Nepal. It guarantees social justice and affirmative action for women, dalits, indigenous groups, the madhesi community, and other excluded or disadvantaged groups. The Interim Constitution also proposes the future restructuring of the state to promote and institutionalise an inclusive, democratic and progressive local governance system, maximising people's participation based on decentralisation, devolution of power and the equitable distribution of resources to local bodies. Elections were successfully completed to form a Constituent Assembly (CA) including holding its first meeting. The CA will also set out the arrangements for the future federal structure of the state; this Assembly will also serve as a national legislature and form a new cabinet until the general election takes place.  1.3   Opportunities    In the context of the unfolding peace process and renewed commitment by the GON and the international community to support local governance, a number of opportunities have emerged: a) The major political parties (Maoists, NC, UML, and MPRF), in their CA election manifestos, have stated their commitment to an inclusive democratic and federal system of government and to devolve local level and community development related functions to local bodies. They have expressed active commitments towards state restructuring to ensure a decentralised, accountable, people-oriented, and democratic self governance system; ending all forms of discrimination, economic exploitation and to address the needs of disadvantaged groups including women, dalits, janajatis, madheshis, old aged, disabled and remote regions and communities by ensuring their participation in state mechanisms, development and empowerment. b) The likely return to elected local representation in local bodies in the years ahead presents the opportunity to begin to strengthen downward accountability in the local government system – and to help redefine the relationship between local administrations and local communities and promoting more constructive interaction. Elected local bodies would be in place after promulgation of the new Constitution. In the meantime, GON has made provisions to fill in the DDC, Municipalities and Village Development Committees by allparty mechanism on the basis of one party one representative, comprising of seven 8  political parties, as mentioned in the interim constitution of Nepal and other political parties who have obtained more than 10 percent verdict of the people (either in proportional or first past the post election of CA) at the district level. These bodies will be given the responsibilities of coordination, planning, conflict resolution, monitoring, and review; and will be able to interact with local community organizations and individual members of the community in planning and decision making on local governance issues. c) There have been positive developments towards improving functioning of the local government since the signing of the peace accord between the political parties. A greater number of VDCs have now become more operational again. District Development Committees (DDCs) and Municipalities remain operational, and – to varying degrees – have done so throughout the conflict. d) The Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction has constituted Local Peace Committees (LPC) at the district level in 29 districts and intends to establish them in all 75 districts. The LPC is also an all party mechanism represented by the chiefs of all the political parties with representation of women, janajati and dalits. There are opportunities to improve linkages with such innovative initiatives in regard to planning and funds flow with the DDC. e) As the peace process deepens and interim arrangements firm up, local bodies are becoming more functional. This will provide the opportunity to foster greater organic links between local governments and communities. f) The government is committed to increasing the volume of fiscal transfers to local bodies, and has, for example, increased the size of VDC block grants from 0.5 million Rs. to 1.0 million. Increased fiscal transfers from the government to local bodies provide the opportunity to strengthen and improve the quality of local infrastructure, service delivery, and empower the community – and will directly contribute to the process of post-conflict reconstruction and recovery. Equally, this also serves as a GON commitment to decentralisation. Similarly, GON is also moving ahead to link allocation of transfers of resources to DDCs and other local governments as a basic measure to improve good governance. g) There is a body of promising innovations and of good practice which have been developed in the country in the past years with the support of various development partners and also NGOs, in regard to both local government, social mobilisation and community support/development, community led prioritization of local needs and also of lessons learned (good and bad), which can inform future programme activities, and facilitate more rapid and efficient implementation of the proposed programme. h) There is a need to improve service delivery at the national and local governments and increase confidence of the people in the governance system. Restoring or increasing the confidence of the people in their government is absolutely crucial for securing a durable peace, and it is therefore important that the GON and development partners work closely together to this end. i)  There is also now a growing realization that there are opportunities to make local governments effective and accountable not only by strengthening them alone but also by enabling communities to have greater ‘voice’ in how they shape their development space, and how they wish to engage with local governments. The underlying premise here is that 9  of upward pressures to enhance good local governance by focusing on communities as well. j)  1.4   Finally, there is now momentum in favour of a harmonised approach by the EDPs to begin to work together to support a national programme. This is underscored by the issuing of joint Guiding Principles in January 2008, by the joint Statement of GON and development partners at the Nepal Donor Consultation meeting in February 2008, and by MLD’s commitment to lead the LGCDP strategically.  Challenges to be addressed   Notwithstanding these opportunities, the current situation presents some fairly substantial challenges which the LGCDP will have to address: • Absence of elected representatives, since 2002, in the local bodies has created leadership vacuum and affected the local government system over the last decade in the country. Violent conflict resulted in the “demobilisation” of the vast majority of VDCs, and narrowed down the “development space” within which DDCs could operate. In some of the VDCs the VDC secretary is still providing services from outside the VDC. This has greatly constrained the scope for interaction between the local governments and communities, and because there are no elected representatives, has minimized the scope for instituting downwards accountability to citizens and communities. As a consequence, there has been a supporting vacuum resulting in a low level of participation by local people in development activities. • Efforts to translate the political commitments of the political parties to strengthen local selfgovernance, state restructuring and the engagement of local bodies with communities to focus into on the broader issues of delivering public goods and services, will be a challenge for any development intervention at the local government level. The overall post-conflict situation throughout the country will have an impact on LGCDP. Although the political situation in the country is gradually improving, there are still a few disturbances in some parts i.e. Terai. It demands flexible modalities to support local governance (working in partnership with civil society, the private sector, local NGOs and Communities) in those areas where conflict reignites. • The long term future for elected local government will depend largely upon the provisions of the new constitution. The outcomes of the future national policy deliberations on federalism and meso as well as local level government structure in the country are difficult to predict in terms of their implications for local government. It implies that support to local governance will need to be very flexible and process-oriented. • Making local governments more sensitive to the "needs" and “voice” of children, women, Dalits, Madhesis, Adibasis Janajatis, and other traditionally marginalised groups is very challenging. The country is a highly stratified society, within which women and the under-privileged exert very little power and within which they find it difficult to articulate their needs and be listened to. Addressing this issue will be a major challenge. • Rapid urbanisation is a challenge for effective municipal governance in Nepal. • Lastly, there remain challenges as to how to adapt “social mobilisation” activities in a manner which allows broad-based as well as targeted community interaction with local government, and 10  promotes downward accountability of the latter; which also successfully addresses the predicaments of the marginalised and “hard-to-reach” segments of rural society; but which can be undertaken at national scale within a short time frame, rather than in a few “favoured” areas over many years.  1.5   The Policy Environment for Decentralisation & Local Governance    Government policy has been consistent in confirming its commitment to equity and meeting the needs of the poor through the delivery of services at the local level. Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2063(2007): The Interim Constitution has made the following provisions: • Conducive environment will be created to promote people’s participation at the grassroots level and create local self-reliant institutional mechanisms to provide services to the people at the local level through decentralisation as an integral part of the governance. • Interim Local Bodies at district, municipality and village level will be created as per consensus made by the political parties. • Balanced approach will be taken in resource mobilisation, allocation and equitable distribution of development results. • Roles and responsibilities of the local bodies will be delineated to make them more accountable in planning and implementation of local level services including revenue mobilisation and allocation. Special attention will be given to uplift the socially and economically backward classes and communities in revenue mobilisation and allocation. The LSGA has established a solid policy and legal framework for local bodies – which is based on local bodies at the district, municipality and village levels. Decentralisation Implementation and Monitoring Committee (DIMC): LSGA has legally created the DIMC under the chair of Hon. Prime Minister with high level representatives as member e.g. Ministers, Leader of Opposition Party, Chairperson of the concerned Committee of the House of Representatives, One representative each of political party representing the parliament, Vice-chairperson of National Planning Commission, Chief Secretary and other Secretaries of GON and representatives of political parties and local bodies association. LSGA has provisioned to form the Decentralisation Implementation and Monitoring Working Committee (DIMWC) under the chair of Minister for Local Development and members from different spheres of local self-governance sector. A Decentralisation Implementation Plan (DIP), a roadmap for the transformation of LSGA, has been prepared by the DIMC in 2000 and started its implementation. Currently, the DIMC and DIMWC is dys-functional as well as the DIP. Local Infrastructure Development Policy: Local Infrastructure Development Policy was formulated in 2004 as per the provisions of the LSGA. GON has divided the development of infrastructure between the strategic or central level and local level after promulgation of the policy. The infrastructure related works at decentralised levels is defined for each infrastructure sector according to the nature of local infrastructure by the policy. The policy makes the local infrastructure responsibility of the District Development Committee (DDC), Municipality and Village Development Committee (VDC). Strategic Plan for the Local Infrastructure Development Policy has also been approved by MLD.  11  The Three-Year Interim Plan (2007/08 to 2009/10) has specified decentralisation as a main means of enhancing good governance, a process of administrative, political, social, and economic and development works, and a strategy for promoting peoples’ participation and people’s empowerment. The following are strategies to improve local governance and community development to address the aforementioned challenges: • Demand driven, targeted and community focused and specific goal-oriented schemes and social mobilisation programs will be implemented to increase the access of people from remote areas, women, children, Dalits, Adibasi Janjatis, Madheshis, Muslims, exploited, marginalised, minority, disadvantaged and other backward groups to resources and opportunities through their increased participation and ownership. TYIP refers to government’s commitment to child participation and child friendly local governance. • The perception of good governance through the strengthening of the local self- governance system will be developed by mobilising internal and external resources for the local bodies and facilitating their effective utilisation, as well as through capacity building, sector wide devolution and through the coordinated efforts of other local level stakeholders. • Human resource development plans on capacity enhancement will be prepared and implemented in the areas relevant to local development. Training sessions will be organised at local level by creating ownership of local authorities. • Emphasis will be given to partnerships with NGOs and the private sector. All governmental, non-governmental and private sectors will be made responsible for facilitating decentralisation and devolution as the major policy for central government and vehicle for the consolidation of the local authorities. • Special attention will be given to the mobilisation and sharing of revenues between local authorities so as to ensure equitable development and to help the overall development of socially and economically backward places, classes and communities. Grants to local bodies will be incorporated within the framework of minimum conditions and performance measures. The total budget allocated to local bodies and the sector-specific central budget will be adjusted scientifically. The Government’s Foreign Aid policy underlines the need for all development programmes and projects to be subject to full ownership by the GON in order to ensure harmonisation and coordination and for development partners to work with the Foreign Aid Joint Coordination Committee in order to avoid duplication and to gradually move towards sector-wide approaches. Governance (Management and Operation) Act, 2008 underlines measures for people oriented, accountable, transparent, inclusive and participatory public administration to provide its benefits to general people, to: • instigate good governance principles and norms such as rule of law, corruption less tidy administration, decentralisation, fiscal discipline and public functions, skilled management of resources to create public service receiving environment rapid • transform civic rights to governance into practice • make legal provision to transform administrative mechanism towards service provider and facilitator to foster realisation of governance in the country The act makes general provisions on operation of administration at different levels such as central, regional, zonal, district and local level with basic fundamental mandates for administrative functions and policies to be followed by GON. It spells administrative functions and responsibility of officials at 12  different levels such as Minister, Chief Secretary, Secretary, Department Chief and Office Chief including work procedure to be adopted during administration. The act specifies self-positional responsibilities of civil servants and makes mandatory provision to keep citizen charter, providing mobile services, determining service fees on the basis of social justice, participation and ownership of people, setting up of Governance Reform Unit in government agencies, conducting public hearing, managing grievances, pursuing information technology in practice, setting up M&E committee and submission of annual report by GON agencies. The Gender Equality/Social Inclusion commitments and policies of the Government such as the Universal Declaration of Human rights, covenants on Economic, Cultural and Social rights, covenants on Political and Civil rights, International commitments made by the GON, such as CEDAW (Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women), the Convention of Child Rights, ILO convention 169 for indigenous and tribal people, etc. underscores the provisions for adopting gender equality and social inclusion friendly approaches in GON programmes. MLD and all its development partners have recently developed Guiding Principles towards Harmonised Local Governance & Community Led Local Development Approach, which • provide a common framework for funding public and community services, infrastructure and other assets which will be channelled through local government and be allocated according to and reflected in local government planning & budgeting processes, depending on the respective functions of the different levels; in this, the VDCs will play the key role in funding destined for community-led proposals, and in monitoring all development activities in their jurisdictions; and • Requires that procedures for working with communities, and for targeting the poorest and most disadvantaged segments of these communities, be rationalised and harmonised in order to ensure greater equity and efficiency, and to reduce transaction costs for the communities themselves. MLD has developed a concept paper (July 2007) on local development and self-governance to bring good governance and development interventions to people by reducing corruption, commission, mismanagement, delays and non-transparent procedures. MLD sets the future direction as follows: • Functional devolution process to be followed to empower people and devolve power to local bodies for self-governance; • Awareness raising to transform state machinery to become more participatory, responsive, accountable, inclusive, and transparent to serve the people; • Implementation of infrastructure development programmes as livelihood options; • Purification process from the leadership level to eradicate corruption, commissions, unfair norms, favouritism, partisanship, delays and misappropriation; • Targeted programs for DAG, the poor and communities to make service delivery more equitable and more easily accessible; and • Transformation from traditional mindsets and external dependency. In its concept paper, MLD has prioritised the following policies and programs: • Change in mindsets/thinking through awareness raising campaigns and structural policy reform • Restructuring of state and local government 13  • • • •  •  •  • • • •  2.   Inclusive and democratic federal forms of government Three levels of government – Central, State and Local Local self-governance at the local level Local autonomy and service delivery to be ensured by the formation of LBs by all party committees that work through consensus and coordination, promotion of e-governance, revision of Act, Policy, Laws and Directives, accountability to people, developing Code of Conduct for both the political representatives and bureaucrats and capacity development for service delivery. Through Local Body Fiscal Commission (LBFC), MLD proposes to strengthen financial monitoring, proper management of revenue collection, public-private partnerships, Minimum Conditions and Performance Measures (MC/PM) adoption for grant allocation and people’s ownership of projects. MLD intends to bring all government service centres/line agencies into Service Backup Centres at the Ilaka (sub-district) level to provide technical assistance to VDCs. Social security: through special allowances and other social assistance schemes (senior citizen allowances, support to the destitute, Persons with Disabilities (PWD), widowers’ allowances); local level employment opportunities (for women, janajati, muslim, DAG, Dalit), a policy of positive discrimination and Vital Event Registration System computerization. DAG empowerment and community development: Special focused programs for DAG such as women, Adabashi, Janajati, marginalised, Dalit, Madheshi; social audit; poverty alleviation programme for the Karnali region (OFOE - One family one employment); remote area development; supplementary and complementary roles of NGOs, private and government sectors. Demands of COs to be integrated into local level planning process; Local infrastructure development Coordination and support Good governance (budget ceilings, rights based development at the local level, notice boards, social/public audits, use of print and electronic media to ensure transparency in programmes and budgets, monitoring & evaluation, and results based development). Paralegal committees for community mediation  Programme Justification   2.1.  Programme Rationale  The programme is premised on a number of considerations: A key element in poverty reduction - is a dramatic improvement in peace establishment through the political settlement; delivery of basic public goods and services (health, education, communication, water, sanitation, senior citizen pensions etc.); and providing the desired services as collective infrastructure, livelihood options, and other services to the communities, especially in rural areas; In a post-conflict context, the need to ensure a tangible peace dividend and a framework for recovery is seen as being a major justification for the programme. LGCDP will positively contribute to constitutional debates and discussions related to devolution and the governance process at the local level with its local level capacity development component, flexible approaches in integrating local communities/groups into the planning process, and making the LBs accountable to people will benefit the future federal state with strong LBs at the local level.  14  Ad hoc distribution of grant needs improvement - criteria based grants will be provided to the local bodies instead of ad hoc distribution. Top up grants will be provided for equitable distribution of the resources to local bodies as part of the peace dividend. Aid effectiveness and harmonisation is necessary for resource synergy and to reduce transaction costs – a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) for decentralisation will be pursued to internalise the provisions of the Foreign Aid Policy of the country including the Paris Declaration. Enabling and strengthening community involvement in local governance processes – in particular by ensuring community decision rights in planning and programming, prioritizing, budgeting, implementing and evaluation of local level programmes and budgets and finding ways to ensure effective representation of the ultra-poor and marginalised groups in these deliberations. Local government and administration has both a potential comparative advantage and a legal mandate to “provide” (finance and ensure delivery of) such goods and services. Central ministries are too far away and tend to provide blueprint, one size fits all services without regard to local context and subject to few accountability pressures; other non-state agencies such as NGOs simply cannot operate to national scale, and are also not subject to local accountability pressures; and community organisations cannot themselves manage public finances or adequately make overall budget priorities for the delivery of these goods and services (other than the very local, micro-schemes of immediate community group interest), although they do play a key role in articulating local priorities and needs, and ensuring accountability. The local government enjoys a potential comparative advantage, the important areas are to: • support increase local government funds, simplify funds flow, develop appropriate reporting formats and improve reporting in local bodies; • make planning, budgeting and public expenditure management procedures transparent including regular and frequent communications with local communities and personnel; • strengthen capacity of local level decision-makers, office-bearers, community groups, own staff etc. through regular training and support; • develop human resources plans for its own staffing needs and local technical needs; • strengthen monitoring and supervision by central government; • ensure a policy and regulatory framework to make it conducive to local good governance; and • accountable local government and administration towards the community and people.  3.   Programme Description    3.1   Programme Duration   The programme is designed for four years for first phase. However, it is expected to continue beyond 2012. Several DPs have expressed interest to further continue their support beyond 2012. 3.1.1   Approach Period   Approach period of the LGCDP will be from June to July 15, 2008, prior to the launch of the programme, to undertake a range of preparatory activities. The MLD and its DPs, with support from a small team of specialised consultants, should jointly launch a detailed assessment of the institutional capacity and preparedness of MLD to perform the tasks and to deliver the capacity building support required in the short to medium term. 15  This will also depart into more detail in terms of determining existing capacities and TA needs and fix the timeline, review efficient ways and means to organise the work, elaborate job descriptions/TOR for core staff, TA and define linkages between MLD and other partners involved. It will also review the options for physically housing the new PCU team and other support staff in the MLD premises etc. 3.1.2  Inception Phase   The LGCDP Inception Phase will be from July 16, 2008 to January 2009. The Phase will be used to start implementation of activities and prepare for a full roll-out of systems, procedures and capacity building support in a flexible way.  3.2   Key Principles and Approaches    The following are the principles and approaches which underlie the LGCDP as GON’s national programme: a) Alignment with government policies including Three-year Interim Plan and MLD Concept Paper on Local Development and Self Governance: LGCDP will be the basis for the implementation of the Three-year Interim Plan (2007/08 – 2009/10) as a GON programme in support of decentralisation and local governance, to which MLD and development partners recently committed. In addition, MLD concept paper (July 2007) which set the future direction of MLD on devolution, local governance and community development activities. It will be designed and implemented in compliance with the present Constitution and the LSGA and related regulations (until new policy & legislation are in place). b) Inclusiveness and gender equity: The strategic goal of LGCDP will be to promote inclusive local democracy, through local community-led development that enables the active engagement of citizens from all sections of society. LGCDP will support socially inclusive and gender and child friendly approaches in the design and implementation of its programmes. Affirmative action policies will be introduced in favour of poor, women and disadvantaged communities to maximise their participation in, and benefits from the programme intervention. Leadership and managerial skills of women and disadvantaged communities (Dalit, Janajatis and others) will be improved through capacity building that leads to their empowerment. Procedures for working with communities, and for targeting the poorest and most disadvantaged segments of these communities, will be rationalised and harmonised in order to ensure greater equity and efficiency, and to reduce transaction costs for the communities themselves. The strategy for all activities will aim at approaches which can be rapidly mainstreamed and scaled-up to national level, and not be “excessively resource intensive, NGO-type experiments” which have no hope of wider replication. c) Community-led development: The programme will operate so as to support community-led development, defined as an approach where citizens and communities either individually or collectively, as active partners in the local governance process, prioritise, implement or fulfil their basic needs through collective action. Users’ committee guidelines will be improved to address the above. d) Rights-based participatory approach: LGCDP will operate according to a rights-based approach based on participatory planning and the development of demand-responsive service providers at local government level. The focus will be on those aspects of poverty reduction which can be addressed through social mobilisation and local government-supported activity (but not on others, 16  e.g. those requiring micro-finance). Social mobilisation and LDF experiences and their best practices adopted in Nepal will be reflected in the new guidelines. LGCDP is committed to advocate for civil rights and to support the emergence and growth of Dalit, differently-abled and women organisations which defend their rights at the local level. e) Adoption of flexible and process-oriented approach: The programme will work to translate GON’s commitments to strengthen local self-governance, state restructuring and the engagement of local bodies with communities with the aim of improving the delivering public goods and services at the local government level. Thus, support to local governance will be flexible and processoriented. This includes consideration of innovative and flexible ways to ensure that the primary program outcome of responsive, inclusive, and accountable local governance through participatory community-led development is attained. f) Peace building: The programme will follow conflict sensitive implementation approach, promoting factors in support of reconciliation and peace building and avoiding those that inhibiting peace or stimulate conflict/violence at the local level. LGCDP will coordinate with the Local Peace Committees (LPC) formed at the district level. The LPCs are constituted by all party representation and function as an early warning mechanism to minimise conflict. The LPCs can build linkages with existing peace groups and networks at the VDC level and can provide support to improve government-citizen interaction. g) The programme will support development of a clear policy and strategy to address the needs of the children, young people, women, conflict victims (families of martyrs disappeared and wounded people) and the disadvantaged. Towards this end, the programme will seek to ensure that their voices are heard in key decision-making processes at the local level, including, to the extent possible, by mainstreaming and institutionalizing their participation in such institutions. This is one specific way by which downward accountability of local governments to the disadvantaged populations can be better ensured. h) Transparency and accountability: The LGCDP will ensure transparency in all its operations budgets, decision making process, and communication to all actors, coordination among line agencies and non-state agencies and in reaching to the remote areas to focus on tangible benefits of the programme at local level. The programme will delineate roles and responsibilities of all the actors and use a systemic programme implementation approach to increase accountability at all levels. i)  Performance/criteria based funding: Funding will be allocated to allow a substantial increase in GON’s current annual grant support to local governments nation-wide, to augment funding available for such goods and services, and also to introduce incentives for better local performance and compliance with agreed governance standards through modified use of the Minimum Conditions/Performance Measures System to pursue implementation of the performance based management provisions of the LSGA. These general, unconditional grant funds will be open for local government expenditure on the “menu” of public goods and services mandated by the LSGA to that particular level of government. A systematised criteria based local development fee will be allocated to the municipalities.  j)  Harmonised approach: The design of the LGCDP will reflect the “Guiding Principles towards Harmonised Local Governance & Community Led Local Development Approach”, recently adopted by all partners. Specifically, it will provide a common framework for funding public and community services, infrastructure and other public assets which will be channelled through central 17  and local government, and be allocated according to and reflected in local government planning & budgeting processes, depending on the respective functions of the different levels. In this, the VDCs will play the key role in funding destined for community-led proposals, and in monitoring all development activities in their jurisdictions. Thus, LGCDP will be a framework to harmonise the multiple donor and NGO projects and to lay the basis for a SWAp in support of decentralised local governance and community development. LGCDP will be a joint programme, bringing together UN agencies (UNDP, UNCDF, UNICEF, UNV and UNFPA); bilateral agencies (DFID, Norway, DANIDA, CIDA, SDC, JICA, GTZ and others); and multilateral banks (World Bank and ADB etc.) k) Downward accountability: The following measures would be adopted to ensure downward accountability to the people and communities; they include: VDC selection will be made based upon category 4 of DAG mapping and gradually category 3, 2, and 1 will be covered by the program; interim all party mechanism at the VDC level will be activated; planning advisory committee will be formed at the VDC level representing civil society, technocrats, and other concern stakeholders; and at the DDC level Integrated Planning Committee will be strengthened; social & public audit system will be placed; income & expenditure will be disclosed in a routine basis during the program period; LB's level public hearing system will be introduced; and participatory planning process will be adopted fully to address the prioritized project of the communities. l)  Mechanism of hearing people voices: People's / DAG voice will be heard through the mechanism of participation; social mobilization process and response will be taken by the LBs. LB's will coordinate local NGO and civil society, and optimize their resources. Civil society raise the voice of the disadvantaged and marginal people; Indigenous Nationalized district coordination Committee; District Dalits Coordination Committee, District Gender Mainstreaming Committee will be further mobilized to address the voice of the people. Addition to these paralegal committee will be strengthened for the mediation against the domestic violence; and to raise the voice of women, children, youth, dalits, janjati , madhesi, muslim, disables and DAG etc. Finally Planning Advisory Committee will ensure these voices are incorporated in the annual work plan and budget.  3.3   Programme Interventions   LGCDP will intervene in the following strategic areas: 3.3.1  Empowerment  of  citizens  and  communities  for  active  engagement  with  local governments and strengthening downward accountability  This aspect of LGCDP is particularly important in the current context where there are no elected local councils. This situation creates the need to pay more attention on downward accountability of local governments. This temporary absence of democratic representation at the local level makes it especially important that LGCDP support community organizations as mechanisms through which all citizens – and especially those from marginalized groups -- can interact with the local authorities and other service providing agencies to have a say in the prioritizations and oversight of local level public funds. It will promote more active and effective interaction by communities – and especially of the more marginalised segments – with their local governments, thereby helping to better articulate community voice, foster community-led development, and hold local governments to account for the services they are supposed to deliver (“micro-level” or “demand”). The LGCDP strategy within this field will be to institutionalise community involvement in discussions and decision making regarding planning, monitoring and implementation of government budgets at the 18  local level, through development of various mechanisms for community participation in local governance. These mechanisms or “rules of the game” will require that local authorities seek broad community involvement and endorsement of decisions on the use of the local block grant as defined in the local body grant guidelines. At the same time LGCDP will support a comprehensive social mobilization effort to ensure that communities are furnished with the capacity to fulfil this role in an inclusive and accountable manner, through a comprehensive social mobilisation effort. It is envisioned that in communities where there are already active community organizations of various types, that LGCDP would work primarily to ensure that the existing organizations are participating in the local governances processes as outlined by the LGCDP in an inclusive, transparent and democratic manner and that all elements in the community they serve – rich and poor, women and men, children and all caste/ethnic groups – have adequate representation. Where no organizations exist, LGCDP’s social mobilisation efforts will be directed towards helping to form and build the capacity of such organizations that can represent their constituents in local governance processes as outlined by the LGCDP. LGCDP will build on the considerable body of existing experience in community participation and social mobilisation generated by several past and ongoing programmes. To this end improved guidelines on community participation, social mobilisation and LDF operational guidelines will be prepared in the inception phase and form the basis for development of a detailed community participation and social mobilisation strategy to be applied by the programme2. As social mobilisation is identified as the principal means for empowering communities and community organisations, the following procedures may be followed3: • DDCs will contract out the Social Mobilisation services to appropriate institutions (private sector or LDF or civil society) based on competitive processes. • A comprehensive SM training programme and operational manual will be designed by LGCDP. All service providers and social mobilisers will be trained and provided with an Operational Manual developed under the supervision of LGCDP – with a view towards ensuring a common approach. • Robust outcome-based monitoring of the performance of social mobilisers (and their support organizations) will be put in place by the LGCDP – with poor performance and failure to achieve the outcomes being accompanied by sanctions. • New VDCs/ward of municipalities will be selected on the basis of DAG mapping using tools already developed by MLD. • DDC will map out the SM agencies (coverage, methodologies etc.) and assess their performance and potential. • DDCs may select appropriate agencies (existing social mobilisers, CBOs, NGOs, private sector) to undertake SM activities. • VDCs will target the most disadvantaged and poorest families by using appropriate criteria.  2  LGCDP will experiment – in areas where conditions permit – with ascertaining the degree to which communities can take the lead role in determining their own priorities, and through access to dedicated funds (and with technical support from local bodies) fulfill their development needs, not necessarily only at the micro level but also in terms of linking up with other communities that may share the same development need/priority. The strength and appeal of the LGCDP is that it has the scope to test innovative and flexible methods of attaining the same vision and outcome. 3 Given the centrality of the role of social mobilisers in empowering communities as envisaged in the Program, specific criteria for their selection will be determined for the new positions; these could include, among others, hired based on merit/technical capacity and credibility amongst local constituents.  19  The social mobilisers’ primary functions will be strengthening local voice and increasing the extent to which local groups and communities can participate actively in the decision making on the use of the block grant and hold their local governments and service delivery agencies to account. This does not detract from the option for socially mobilised groups and organisations to engage with various agencies or programmes to access livelihoods-based assistance. A community led social development approach will be followed that will strengthen community participation in local governance. The LGCDP socially mobilised groups will be able to influence the use of block grants and in many cases be the implementing body in the production of goods and services by engaging with the regular local planning and budgeting process - as well as access services/assets/grants from service delivery agencies, NGOs or other donor-funded programmes. The social mobilisation methods will ensure social inclusion to enable citizens from marginalised/disadvantaged groups to participate in public affairs – be it by interacting with local government or with public services and other agencies. Addressing the structural causes of inequality and exclusion requires both changes in the formal rules by which local governments and services operate and – the more challenging -- transformation in people’s attitudes and behaviour. This may require “targeted” SM and this will be adopted by the LGCDP. At the same time LGCDP will ensured that this targeted SM approach does not result in the exclusion/alienation of better-off or more privileged members of the wider community, who may become resentful or obstructive. This SM intervention will also focus on the wider capacity of communities and marginalised groups to articulate their needs and priorities and to exercise their rights in regard to local government and administration. This will be undertaken by support to a range of activities: giving such communities, where clearly possible, resources and technical support to be able to fund their development priorities or pool with others, the rights to prioritize their needs and/or methods of how they wish to attain their developmental outcomes, information and awareness campaigns on local governance issues, using innovative and non-conventional approaches; dissemination of local government plans, budgets, expenditures, etc; support to social audits, public hearings, etc; training and support to the local and national media to ensure more informed and active reporting of local governance issues; support to public expenditure tracking surveys and the dissemination of findings. Once the interim local governments are established, a key activity will also be in training and guiding these bodies in the basics of responsible local governance and local government-community relations. 3.3.2  Local  bodies  top­up  block  grants  for  community  led  local  development  (DDC, Municipality and VDC)  This component will aim to ensure two particular outcomes: (a) not only strengthening the ability of local government to respond and to deliver the public and collective goods and services which they are mandated to provide but also (b) again, where conditions permit, giving local governments an opportunity to utilize a portion of the top-up block grants to experiment with innovative and flexible methods to attain the Programme outcome.4 A cardinal principle underlying this component will be that all public funding for such goods and services will be channelled through local government and be allocated locally on the basis of bottom-up planning and budgeting processes. LGCDP will provide support both to improving these funding mechanisms and to improving local government planning, budgeting and overall management, within the statutory frameworks.  4  As before, the decision making process on which local government body has access to how much resources to experiment with how to attain the developmental outcome will be ascertained.  20  Funding will be allocated to allow a substantial increase in the current annual grant support to local governments nation-wide, to augment funding available for such goods and services, and also to introduce incentives for better local performance and compliance with agreed governance standards (through modified MC/PM system). These general, unconditional grant funds will be open for local government expenditure on the “menu” of public goods and services mandated by the LSGA to that particular level of government. Special attention will be paid to phasing-in this mechanism at VDC level, and to using it also to leverage better management of the existing block grant allocations. Top-up grants will be blended together with the GON block grant and will be provided in the form of capacity development grants and development grants. Support will also be provided to allow GON to move towards more equitable formula-based allocations, which pay due regard to differing fiscal potential and poverty levels of different areas. In regard to municipalities, prior to roll-out of topped up block grants for the smaller less resource endowed (non-metropolitan) municipalities and the use of the MC/PM system, a thorough review of the entire system will be conducted, including a review of the type of grants to be included and the options for reforms of some of these grants. It is important that the performance-based grants are of sufficient size to ensure strong incentives for improved performance. For metropolitan, sub-metropolitan, and larger and fiscally stronger municipalities the overall system of finance (own source revenues, taxes, user fees, borrowing etc.) will be reviewed and reforms supported from the Programme. This general grant mechanism will be complemented by one or more targeted, conditional or earmarked grant mechanisms – the programme will pay special attention to developing mechanisms for safety net or social protection funding arrangements, which target disadvantaged and marginalised groups. Here, too, the Program will consider whether an innovative method exists to ensure that resource allocations are subject to revealed preferences of the recipients. In addition, there will be a focus on improving local tax revenue administration, and render this in a more transparent way, since this will be a key ingredient in the emergence of accountable local government bodies in the future, once local councils are back in place. 3.3.3   Capacity development of local governments for effective service delivery  LGCDP will pay attention to capacity building and procedures of local governments at all levels, and their financing arrangements, to promote more effective delivery of basic infrastructure and services (“meso-level” or “supply”). The principles underlying these activities are that the focus will be on rolling out and also improving GON’s statutory procedures and regulations, that additional personnel will be kept to a strict minimum and that where possible demand-driven mechanisms should be used. It is envisaged that these activities will therefore consist of: • “supply-driven” training and awareness raising of the different types of personnel in the different levels of local government, through the roll-out of standard packages and curricula; • more “demand-driven” mechanisms whereby local governments may use capacity development grants to buy-in specific types of support from pre-certified training agencies (which will also be brought to standard through the programme); • a variation on the demand-driven approach, whereby local governments may use a (small) part of the enhanced grants to contract-in specific technical support to help implement their 21  investment and service delivery programmes. This will be especially important at VDC level – VDCs will be encouraged to cooperate to use these funds to engage overseers, other technicians, accounting staff, etc, on short/long term basis; • Support to DDCs to enable them to better monitor and support VDCs; etc. A final but strategically critical element in this intervention will be the testing of refinements and improvements to specific procedures and institutional arrangements (consistent with the overall statutory framework) for national roll-out. Examples of such areas are: bottom-up planning and budgeting; DDC– line agencies coordination in planning and delivery; conditional grants to promote sector devolution; and targeted safety net or social protection mechanisms. Such testing would be undertaken on a limited scale for one or two years and – once results have been analysed and policymakers are in agreement with the innovations – these would then be rolled out nationally. 3.3.4   Policy support for decentralisation and local governance (devolution, fiscal  decentralisation,  human  resources  development  for  policy  making,  action  research etc.)  The intervention aims to address the development of an enabling policy, regulatory and support framework for devolution, local governance and community development including the policy implementation capacities of MLD and other national bodies (“macro-level”). There will be two elements to this: • Support will be provided for improvements in the policy and regulatory framework, to promote sector devolution and fiscal decentralisation (by clarifying functions and expenditure assignments of local governments, and developing a more appropriate architecture for centrelocal transfers, etc), more effective local government staffing arrangements, a more robust framework for gender and social inclusion, etc. In the interim period, this will be based on the LSGA framework, but as and when new policy and legislation emerges the focus will be on adaptation to the new context as well. • Support will also be provided for central government and other national institutions to play their due support and mentoring functions in regard to local government: development of standard operating procedures, training manuals, and core curricula for different categories of local government and personnel; build-up of national/regional lists of pre-qualified public and private training agencies; enhancement of MLD’s ability to formulate policy and procedures in key areas, to monitor local government performance, to support, mentor and communicate with these bodies, and to coordinate with other key ministries; roll-out of, and regular adjustment to, the MC/PM methodology; support to Office of Auditor General; etc. Throughout, activities under this component will be governed by two considerations: avoidance of preempting any major future policy option in regard to the shape of the sub-national government; but – at the same time - rapid adjustment to any such policy changes which emerge from the newly elected government during the programme period. However, given the uncertainties surrounding policy on decentralisation and local government, LGCDP will have modest policy ambitions. Policy-level “fine-tuning” will largely concern "small" policy – systems and procedures, ways of doing business, and the like, building on and consistent with the statutory framework of the LSGA. What is vital for LGCDP is to keep local government "on the map" whilst major policy processes are ongoing.  22  3.4   Programme objective   3.4.1  Goal  LGCDP's over-arching goal will be to contribute towards poverty reduction through inclusive responsive and accountable local governance and participatory community-led development that will ensure increased involvement of women, Dalits, Adibasi Janajatis, Muslims, Madhesis, disadvantaged groups in the local governance process. Ultimately, then, LGCDP will be judged by the extent to which it delivers real and tangible benefits to the poor and to citizens as a whole. 3.4.2  Purpose  The Purpose of the Programme will be “Improved access to locally and inclusively prioritised public goods and services”. This will be achieved through both supply and demand side intervention – specifically, through integrating mechanisms for the exercise of shared community decision rights over the block grant allocations for service delivery and clear community oversight responsibilities into the local government system. The programme will contribute to the overall state-restructuring process by making the state at the local level more accountable to people in respect to the allocation of discretionary fiscal resources, increased block grants and own-source revenues. The public finance aspects of local government will be integrated with community participation and community led initiatives to create state-citizen interface for nation building. 3.4.3  Outcomes  The programme will contribute towards attaining the goal through achieving its three major Programme Outcomes (each of which effectively constitutes a programme component) i.e. (1) citizens and communities empowered; (a) to exercise their voice to a large degree than currently exist (b) to engage actively with local governments and local government resource allocation, decision making and (c) Accounting processes structured to enable greater citizen-community input and oversight; (2) Increased capacity of local governments to manage resources and deliver basic services in an inclusive and equitable manner; and (3) Strengthened policy and national institutional framework for decentralisation, devolution and community development. LGCDP will be a national programme of support for decentralisation, local governance, and community development with the intent of working throughout the country and at all levels of the local governments. To achieve its programme outcomes LGCDP will focus on four strategic areas: • Ensuring active and effective participation by communities in the local development processes and strong interface with their local governments, in order to better articulate community voice and to hold their local governments to account for the services and resources that they are supposed to deliver, and communities empowered to fulfil this role. • Building the capacities and procedures of local bodies, and their financing arrangements, to promote more effective delivery of basic infrastructure and services. Programme funds will be 23  used as leverage, but activities would be deliberately designed so as to apply to the use and management of all fiscal resources of the local bodies and not just those provided by donors. This area of activity also (and necessarily) includes working at the national level, in order to ensure as enabling a policy and institutional environment as possible. • Assisting in the development of the overall policy and enabling regulatory framework for devolution and local governance, community development, social empowerment and safety net. Policies for empowering socially and economically marginalised groups/families while also will be strengthened, as well as building the capacity of MLD and other national agencies to play their appropriate supportive and supervisory role for local governments. Establishing the preconditions for harmonised donor support for local government and following SWAp. • Institutional mechanism for downward accountability: The programme will explicitly seek to strengthen formal upward and downward accountability mechanisms. As elected representatives are not in place in the local bodies, alternative institutional mechanisms for downward accountability are needed to ensure that decision rights are vested in all sections of the community, assuring quality control of Social Mobilisers, and implementing social accountability mechanisms. At the same time activities will be aimed at ensuring the capacity of communities to not only hold decision makers accountable but also act on their development prioritization. Basic tools (e.g. public hearings, public audits, social audits, hoarding boards, publication of annual plan budget and expenditure and mechanisms to report corruption and misappropriation of goods and funds, etc.) will be used for this purpose.  3.5   Results Framework   This section provides a brief narrative description of the programme’s structure, its three main components and associated outputs and indicative activities (see Annex 2 – Logical Framework). It should be noted that each of the three programme components will be further elaborated upon through the development of detailed implementation and operational guidelines – which will define precise implementation modalities. Component 1: Citizens and communities engaged actively with local governments  and hold them accountable  This component of LGCDP aims to promote the capacities of communities, and especially the more disadvantaged groups and those in more remote rural areas, urban pockets to articulate their needs and priorities and to make their claims on local government and resources – in other words, to promote more effective “demand” and voice. Activities under this component are explicitly intended to ensure that communities and community organisations are able to access these resources and use them in ways that are consistent with local needs and priorities. Social mobilisation activities will enable/empower communities and community organisations to engage in the local level bottom-up planning process (as provided for by LSGA – see annex 4) in order to ensure that they access the public resources and services that they require and need on a priority basis, There are two outputs that LGCDP will be expected to deliver under this component.  24  Output 1.    Communities  and  community  organisations  participate  actively  in  local  governance processes   Output 1 activities will aim at enabling communities and community-based organisations to interact with local governments (largely, but not exclusively, with VDCs). This will include active participation in the planning/budgeting process, and in the decisions about implementation, and oversight of local government actions and activities. Local governments will keep open channels of communication and foster dialogue with various sections of the population (women, youth, and marginalized groups) and insure clear decision making rights in the prioritization of projects and allocation of block grant funds. For this output, indicative activities are as follows: 1.1  Establish institutional mechanisms through which communities and community organisations can participate in the local planning, implementation and oversight process  This activity will link up – in a tangible form – its “demand” and “supply” components. What is envisaged here is the establishment of a structure in each DDC and VDC, which can ensure the participation of representative members of the community in local planning, implementation and oversight processes. The structure should serve as a forum for discussion on the priorities of different sections of the community for the use of block grants between themselves and with the VDC/DDC and the local representatives of political parties. As a minimum condition the structure should be tasked with making decisions on the prioritisation of activities and allocation of resources within the annual VDC/DDC plan, selection of CBOs and/or private service providers to undertake implementation, monitoring and quality control of the projects financed and implemented under the plan and reporting on implementation through the MC/PM system.5 The exact way in which such a structure could be established and function will need to be subject to further studies in the inception phase of the programme, taking into account the different experiences from Nepal as well as legislation and practices for decision making in local governance as outlined in the Local Self Governance Act. In particular, the question of how to select community members to participate in the structure with a view to ensuring that they are representative of the entire community, in particular marginalised groups, will need to be considered carefully. There are likely to be different ways such a structure could be established and in different parts of the country it would probably work in different ways. The programme should not take too rigid an approach to what the structure looks like, as long as it makes sure that a mechanism is in place in all DDCs/VDCs that meets the minimum conditions outlined above. Key decision points in resource allocations are in the councils and committees at local level. The programme will put in place rules and procedures to ensure that the views of the community cannot be circumvented in the decision making process. Steps in establishment of the structure at the local level could include: • Strengthening community representation in District, Village and Municipal Councils – in the absence of elected committee members - ensure that in addition to the all party mechanism and the DDC/VDC and municipal officials, all sections of the community are represented in 5  This, however, the portion of the top-up grants that could be available based upon prioritized projects for communities to have more access to resources, procedures to be established inthe inception phase.  25  village council decision making within the areas defined in the Local Self Governance Act, including final approval of plans and budgets. • At DDC level strengthening of the Integrated Plan Formulation Committee (IPFC) provided for in the Local Self Governance Act to include community representatives, proper representation of disadvantaged groups and political parties and at the VDC and municipal level formation of similar planning committees, which will work with the Village and municipality Development Committees to execute their duties as these are defined in the Local Self Governance Act, including the preparation of plans and budgets. Sub-activities will thus include: • Map out modalities and experiences from various countries in participatory planning procedures including relevance experiences, if any from within Nepal. • Devise modalities for appropriate solutions in a Nepal context. preclude • Draw up plans for the implementation of selected mechanisms. • Support the functioning of mechanisms, when established, particularly with respect to safeguarding the participation of community members and disadvantaged groups. • Organise wider consultation including budget meetings in which community members can participate; • Promote the use of secret ballot when projects are prioritized and resources are allocated to insure that weaker members of the decision making forum are not intimidated in the exercise of their choice. • Institute more robust disclosure requirements for local governments (budgets, tenders, reports etc. posted on public notice boards and use of other means). • Improving scheme implementation and procurement procedures, to provide opportunities for local citizens to be involved in both implementing schemes and in overseeing their completion through social audit processes (by, for example, encouraging inclusively formed VDC level community/user groups to be recognised by the LBs to function as formal ‘User Committees” for implementation). 1.2  Strengthen the capacity of communities and community organisations to participate in the local planning, implementation and oversight process  This activity serves to provide a purpose for social mobilisation, which should be seen as contributing to improving the quality of local governance and local governance processes – by (a) facilitating community participation in local government planning and budgeting; (b) making downward accountability more robust and effective through active community engagement with local government; and (c) increasing community involvement in priotization, implementation and oversight of service delivery activities. Seen this way, social mobilisation is a means to an end, rather than end in itself – firmly anchored in local governance processes and oriented towards helping communities and community organisations to interface with local governments and other service delivery agencies (e.g. health centres, NGOs, etc.) at the local level. Sub-activities will thus include: • Develop a strategy for SM within areas a, b and c outlined above • As part of the above mentioned strategy, develop special criteria and modalities for mobilisation and inclusion of disadvantaged groups (DAGs). • Map out DDC/VDCs according to degree of mobilisation already in place and define modality for the coverage of social mobilisation activities 26  • Establish criteria for choosing VDCs for roll out • Conduct social mobilisation with community organisations – method depending on the level of maturity of the local area with training in community mobilisation and principles of local community participation.6 • Prepare implementation framework and exit strategies for LGCDP SM activities. Output 2.    Increased  capacity  of  citizens,  communities  and  marginalized  groups  to  assert their rights and hold local governments accountable.   This output will ensure that the general public becomes more aware of local governance issues and processes. In addition, the programme will work towards providing communities with more meaningful opportunities to access resources for own determined priorities and to hold their local governments to account for their performance (in terms of effectively and efficiently satisfying local needs and priorities) including rights-based perspective. Three sets of indicative activities will enable the programme to deliver this output. 2.1  Carry out information, education and communication (IEC) activities  Here, the programme will focus on providing the general public with access to basic information about the local government system. In addition, IEC activities will ensure that citizens are provided with accurate and timely information on core local governance issues – institutional arrangements (LSGA and related regulations), citizen charters, service delivery responsibilities, human rights vis-à-vis local governments, local government budgets and budget allocations, revenues, local government expenditures, audit outcomes, the outcomes of MC/PM assessments, the specific rights of women, children, the youth, and DAG etc. Important GE/SI and CY sensitive issues will be considered in both the choice of messages, materials, and the way they are delivered (languages, audio/print media etc.). This activity will be out-sourced to a media consulting firm or other capable public/private undertakings through a competitive bidding process to manage on a day-to-day basis, under the supervision of the documentation, information and publications section of MLD. The process will be defined by the LGCDP PCU in its regular work-planning process and submitted to the programme’s Consultative/Advisory Committee for endorsement. Sub-activities will therefore include the following: • • • • • • • •  Identify core IEC messages to be disseminated (as per the requirements of the communities) Identify and contract key media for IEC activities Disseminate basic messages about LG (LSGA, decentralisation policies, etc.) Provide basic information to the public (block grants, audit outcomes, MC/PM assessments, public expenditure tracking system etc.) Support MLD to perform the activities on IEC Support (training and information) to media on local governance issues Criteria based funds allocation system as per expenditure assignments; Local communities have clear stakes for responsibilities assigned to and for them;  (Some VDCs already have functioning community organizations that network most of the community organizations that exist for specific purposes or to serve specific groups and provide a forum for discussion and identification of collective priorities; other VDCs have many individual special purpose groups but there is a need to bring them together; still other VDCs have very few or no community organizations and have not been “mobilized” by external agents – though of course they do have their traditional social structures. The type of training and mobilization efforts needed in these different situations need to be thought through )  6  27  • • • • • 2.2  Annual, external, financial audits of local governments; Improved regular reporting and follow-up on the results; MC/PM assessments7; Social audit, public audit, public hearing processes; Information dissemination campaigns, aimed at providing the public with information about local government affairs, block grant allocations and other aspects of LGCDP. Strengthen mechanisms for local and community level advocacy, monitoring and oversight of local governance issues  The programme design recognises that it will be necessary to go simultaneously with social mobilisation and core IEC activities in order to foster more meaningful interaction between citizens and civil society, on the one hand, and local governments, on the other. Increasing the breadth and depth of accountability mechanisms for local governments is seen as being a vital way of ensuring that increased fiscal transfers are properly and effectively managed by local governments. To do this the programme will support the use of a range of mechanisms through which local citizens can hold their local governments accountable Support will be provided through the establishment of a semi-autonomous Local Governance and Accountability Facility (LG&AF) which will be able to finance a range of activities, including information to and interactions within communities and between communities and local governments on corruption problems, promotion of social audits, support to community vigilance groups and support to local media for critical and informed coverage of local governance issues. Given the critical nature of this type of activities work plan will be prepared by a semi autonomous facility, with a separate board with participation of MLD, donors and independent civil society representatives. The design of modalities and guidelines for the facility will be made during the inception phase.8 2.3  Provide technical and capacity building support to citizens' institutions led by disadvantaged groups to promote interactions with LBs  The programme will – in addition to the general capacity building support to community organisations under output 1.2 - provide special support to disadvantaged groups and organisations representing them, in order to strengthen their (a) interaction with - and voice in - local government, and (b) ability to set own priorities and attain resources to fund them. This activity will also strengthen and support the existing district level coordination committees of dalits, janajatis and women. It will ensure that capacity building support to the COs led by disadvantaged communities are not left out. Further specification of these activities will be undertaken in the inception period. The sub-activities will include the following: • Identify COs (including DDC-level dalit, janajati and other committees) led by disadvantaged communities • Assess need of such COs’ • Fine tune mandate of COs 7  MCPM provide numerous safeguards, and for which the outcomes are made publicly available – this tool will promote a dialogue on the LB performance and ways and means to strengthen this weaker areas 8 Sub-activities for semi-autonomous Local Governance and Accountability Facility (LG&AF) may include: management arrangements, establish local governance and accountability facility, organizing and supporting social audits, support to civil society groups and public vigilance agencies, supporting CSOs/CBOs to organizations and media etc. and establishing mechanisms for disseminating information about good local government practices, producing citizen report cards;  28  • Provide support for training on local governance issues • Provide technical assistance and advisory services to such COs including advocacy for civil rights • Provide support for appropriate institutional setup and legal landing mechanisms Component 2: Increased capacity of local governments to manage resources and  deliver basic services in an inclusive and equitable manner.  Component 2 recognises that whilst making the “demand” side of local governance more effective (through Component 1), little will be achieved unless the “supply” side is also strengthened – to effectively meet the increased demands articulated by and heightened expectations of local communities and citizens. Local governments (DDCs, VDCs and municipalities) need to build up their capacities to respond appropriately and effectively to expressed priorities and needs. For this to happen, the programme will deliver three outputs. Output 3.    Local governments gain access to greater fiscal resources in equitable and  appropriate ways   Increased block grant transfers to DDCs, municipalities and VDCs will enable local governments to deliver more public goods and services and respond more effectively to citizens’ needs and priorities. Increased block grant transfers will also act as a fiscal incentive for empowerment, providing local citizens with more reasons to participate in local governance because more resources will be at stake. The minimum conditions (MC) and performance measures (PM) linked to the development grants will promote better performance in core areas such as planning, financial management and good governance/transparency. There is one output that LGCDP will be expected to deliver under this component. Through this output, the programme will significantly increase the size of fiscal transfers made to local governments – thereby enabling DDCs, VDCs and municipalities to finance the production of more local public goods and services. Importantly, this will be done on the basis of performance (as measured through MC/PM assessments). On a more selective basis, LGCDP will also seek to improve local ownsource revenue collection. (i)  The roll-out and uptake strategy9 for block grants will be : • DDCs (75) as the necessary systems and procedures are more or less in place. • VDCs (roll out from year one – with inclusion on basis of a set of simple MCs and poverty targeting). In Year one, topping up of VDC grants will be done in around 900 VDCs based on a screening of minimum conditions and DAG mapping criteria (see Annex 1). In the following years 2000 VDCs will be targeted in FY 2009/10, 3000 VDCs in FY 2010/11 and all eligible VDCs in FY 2011/12. More detailed piloting of systems for VDC block grants will be carried out in a smaller number of VDCs (50). • Municipalities: Roll out from year two. Prior to roll-out of topped up block grants for the smaller (non-metropolitan) municipalities10 and the use of the MC/PM system, a thorough review of the entire system will be conducted, including a review of the type of grants to be included and the  9  Detailed strategy of the expanded block grants will be developed during the inception period Municipalities with less resources have been categorized by MLD on the basis of - i) rural characteristics, ii) less resources, iii) smaller population, and iv) small number of enterprises in the municipalities but further review of the eligible municipalities will be conducted in year one.  10  29  options for reforms of some of these grants. It will be assessed that the performance-based grants are of sufficient size to ensure strong incentives for improved performance. In year two, topping up of municipal grants will be done gradually starting with some municipalities in FY 2009/10 with a gradual expansion over the following years. • For larger metropolitan and sub-metropolitan municipalities, the overall system of finance (own source revenues, taxes, user fees, borrowing etc.) will be reviewed and reforms supported from the Programme. (ii)  Investment menus for the topping-up will follow those applicable to GON’s development grants (block grants), allowing for a certain percentage (up to 7% of the total top-up) to be used for covering investment in servicing costs. Concerning the DDC grants, this investment servicing part will also cover an amount (2%) for support to the VDCs in areas such as preparation, planning, accountability and reporting. VDCs and municipalities can spend up to 5% of their expanded block grants on investment servicing costs. The investment menu in the development grants will be reviewed and defined in order to ensure that the investments made by each tier of the LB system, are in accordance with the principles of subsidiary and the expenditure assignments across tiers of the LB system and targeted towards service delivery and infrastructure improvements.  (iii)  The budgetary consequences of the topping up of the grants will be estimated (depending on final decisions about roll-out and uptake), and on the basis of expected levels of compliance with the minimum conditions for access to grants.  (iv)  Allocation criteria for block grants (largely population-based with additional criteria for cost differentials and poverty targeting) will be elaborated. There is a need to keep allocation formula simple. The existing formula for DDCs can easily be improved by modifying the application and weighting of the existing criteria applied (particularly for HDI and the cost index).  (v)  Funds from GON and development partners’ will be merged and transferred to LBs as one common allocation.  (vi)  The application of the MC/PMs will be defined. The blended grants will contain a minimum eligible allocation for each LB (e.g. about 20-30 % of the total blended development block grant) and that the remaining amount (the largest share) be allocated in accordance with the results of the MC/PM system. This will ensure that robust incentives remain in place, at the same time as ensuring a minimum level of activities within each LB.  (vii)  Preparations for the topping up of VDC block grants will be started as soon as possible. Based on the results of the planned studies by MLD, piloting of MCs will be conducted in year one and then scaled up from year two onwards. An assessment system will be designed, based on a DDC-managed review process with some kind of support and quality assurance from the national assessment of DDCs.  Several sets of indicative activities will enable the programme to deliver this output. 3.1  Provide formula and performance based (MC/PM) block grants to DDCs  DDC capital grants will be calculated on the basis of a simple (criteria) formula, made available to DDCs subject to compliance with Minimum Conditions (MCs) and calibrated in accordance with annual 30  performance (as determined by PMs). Such top-up grants and their use will be determined through a participatory planning process. Sub-activities include: • Revise grant formula and guidelines, define investment menu and improve reporting systems and formats • Put in order /refine DDC block grant formula • Disburse DDC block grants 3.2  Provide formula and performance based (MC) block grants to VDCs  VDC capital grants will be based on similar principles to those underlying DDC grants. VDCs will become eligible for capital grants subject to their demonstrating compliance with a simple set of MCs, to be developed through piloting. Again, their use would be largely discretionary and determined through a bottom-up planning process. Sub-activities will include: • Select the first batch of VDCs for the gradual roll-out of block grants, based on objective criteria such as poverty and absorption capacity/minimum capacity to handle funds • Review/up-date the VDC block grant guidelines • Put in order VDC block grant formula • Prepare and pilot MC/PM • Disburse VDC block grants – gradual phasing in 3.3  Provide formula and performance based (MC/PM) block grants to non metropolitan municipalities  Smaller/less fiscally endowed municipalities will receive capital block grants from LGCDP. Such LGCDP-funded municipal grants will be consistent with any financing procedures developed by MLD. Sub-activities will include: • • • • • 3.4  Define the municipal grant system for block grant formula (application and size) Elaborate block grant guidelines Elaborate municipal block grant formula Refine and implement MC/PM system Disburse municipal block grants Support to development of the metropolitan, sub-metropolitan and larger municipalities funding system  Metropolitan and sub-metropolitan municipalities will receive reforms support from the Programme based on their overall system of finance (own source revenues, taxes, user fees, borrowing etc.). Subactivities will include: • Review and recommend the funding system for metropolitan and sub-metropolitan municipalities • Implement recommendations to improve on the overall system of funding including systems for improved performance incentives  31  3.5  Assess MC/PM of all supported local governments  A key principle underlying programme’s financing of local governments is that access to top-up grants should be contingent upon their performance (as measured through MC/PM assessments)11. Subactivities for all of this will include: • • • • •  Design MC/PM assessment process for VDCs and finalise the municipal tool Train DDCs in use of VDC MC/PM assessment methodology Develop systems of quality assurance and approval of results Provide DDCs with financial and logistical support to carry out VDC MC/PM assessments Provide MLD/LBFC with support to contract out MC/PM assessments for DDCs and municipalities and QA of the VDC assessments • Provide MLD/LBFC with current support to up-date and refine the system (linked to output 6)  3.6  Provide support for own source revenue collection by LGs  In order to provide local governments with a limited degree of fiscal autonomy, the programme will (on a selective basis) support own-source revenue collection by DDCs, municipalities and VDCs. This support will include the following sub-activities: • • • • • • • 3.7  Assess existing tax/revenue base for LGs Assess LG revenue administration procedures Identify ways of expanding LG tax/revenue base - tax potential studies Identify options for improving LG tax/revenue administration Fine tune LG revenue collection/administration manuals Establish improved linkage between revenue and service delivery Provide training to LG officials and elected/nominated representatives Review and refine revenue & expenditure assignments and types of revenue  Revenue and expenditure assignments and types of revenues at the LBs will be reviewed by the programme through the LBFC. Sub-activities will include: • Review revenue and expenditure sharing arrangements • Review appropriateness of existing types of revenue (e.g. LDF, house and property tax) • Support implementation of any proposed reforms to revenue/expenditure sharing arrangements and types of revenues Output 4.    Appropriate  capacity  building  services  passed  on  to  all  levels  of  the  local  government service delivery system   In the case of DDCs and municipalities, basic MC/PM methodologies have already been developed – and LGCDP will simply assist the LBFC in their application. For VDCs, however, MC/PM methodology is currently not in place and will therefore need to be developed (simplified MC/PM). Given the relatively large number of VDCs in Nepal, simple and easy to use performance assessment method will be administered by DDCs (rather than by consultants contracted by the Ministry) combined with certain QA from the national assessment teams conducted the DDC/Municipal assessments. The entire set of MC/PM indicators will be revisited to better incorporate GE/SI concerns and thus provide greater incentives for their mainstreaming into local government processes. 11  32  Whilst access to more fiscal resources will undoubtedly strengthen the capacity of local governments to respond to priorities and needs, developing systemic and human capacities will also be required. The programme will deliver such capacity building in a variety of ways. This will also allow for the inclusion of capacity building for implementation/production functions, many of which will be fulfilled by agencies (e.g. user groups, community organisations, and private sector contractors) which are not a part of the local government system per se. This output of the LGCDP will be important in regard to: • a core, supply-driven, component through which (a) all LGs are provided with training in the basics and (b) general purpose systems and procedures are developed and disseminated in the form of user-friendly manuals; • a demand-driven component through which DDCs and municipalities formulate their own capacity development plans (CDPs) and finance their implementation out of annual capacity development grants (CDGs) – out-sourcing to pre-certified capacity development service providers; and • A DDC-led system of support, regular backstopping and mentoring for VDCs. This output will enable local bodies to establish the important linkages between: i) development grants; ii) the incentives (rewards and sanctions, assessment systems); and iii) the LBs’ ability to address the identified functional gaps and weaknesses in an equitable manner. Several sets of indicative activities will enable the programme to deliver this output. 4.1  Design and allocate CD grants for LGs  In the medium term, LGCDP aims to strengthen the extent to which local government capacity building becomes demand-driven. Part of this will include providing local governments (initially DDCs) with capacity development grants, with which they will be able to purchase the specific CD services that they require. LGCDP’s Capacity Development Grants (CDG) to local governments will be rolled out as soon as possible to DDCs and then to municipalities. The CD grants should kick in from year two of the programme, as it will take some time to prepare for this new demand driven modality. CDGs will be independent of the top-up block grants and will be calculated on the basis of a transparent and appropriate formula that divides up a total annual CD funding pool. A menu of eligible expenditures (and related rules) will be drawn up, setting ceilings on certain expenditure items (e.g. equipment, training, study tours, etc.). With respect to VDCs, CDGs may not be appropriate in the short term given that the capacity of the VDCs to handle this type of grant may take more time to prepare for. In the short term, then, the DDCs should ensure coverage of VDC capacity development needs out of the DDC CDGs. Sub-activities will consist of the following: • • • • •  Prepare formula for CD grants Define the eligible expenditures to be covered by the grants Inform LGs of CD grant system Disburse CD grants to LGs Monitor the utilisation of the grants and adjust (on an annual basis) 33  4.2  Earmark LGs’ access to TA funds (embedded in block grants)  Through LGCDP, local governments will be able to use a percentage of their top-up grants to procure specialised technical assistance (e.g. consultant, engineer, technicians etc.). The proportion of block grants that can be used by local governments for purposes of procuring technical assistance and investment servicing costs should not exceed 7% for DDCs (of which 2% goes for mentoring / monitoring of VDCs), 5% for VDCs and municipalities of the total value of the block grant. However, and depending on the extent to which block grants are weighted by population size, a “floor” allocation for investment servicing costs will be introduced in order to avoid inadequate allocations for demographically small LGs. In addition, LGs will directly procure such TA and/or investments services – and not hire additional permanent staff. Sub-activities will include: • Elaborate capacity building block grant strategy and implementation arrangements • Communicate to DDCs, VDCs and municipalities on the size of the block grants earmarked for TA 4.3  Provide support to DDCs for backstopping and mentoring of VDCs  Given the level of fiscal resources that will be made available to VDCs (through both regular Government block grants and LGCDP top-up grants), and the increased demands that will therefore be placed on VDCs to properly manage those resources, the programme will develop procedures and subsequently support DDC backstopping and mentoring of VDCs. In this respect, DDCs will probably need to provide VDCs with backstopping in areas such as financial management, planning, implementation, etc. DDCs will establish task teams for this, constituted on an as-needed and subject-wise basis. For example, if VDCs require backstopping for financial management, then it would be best that DDC accounts office staff provides this. According to guidelines, approximately 2 % of the block grants for the DDC can be used for backstopping support to the VDCs in areas such as planning, appraisal, reporting and accountability (funded from the investment service costs above). However, within the DDC one unit will assume overall responsibility for coordinating task – i.e. this task could be assigned to DDC Human Resource Development Unit. The LGCDP should further explore these options as part of the implementation arrangements. Sub-activities will include: • Prepare guidelines for DDC backstopping and mentoring of VDCs • Disseminate guidelines to DDCs and VDCs • Build a facilitating team within DDC including line agencies’ officials if needed/necessary, using contracted NGOs/companies to support the teams in up-start phase. • Train DDCs in backstopping and mentoring of VDCs  34  4.4  Prepare LGs GE/SI Capacity Development (CD) plan  In order to promote an increasingly demand-driven approach to capacity development, the programme will introduce a simple capacity development planning methodology to local governments. This will start with DDCs and municipalities, but will eventually include VDCs as well. DDCs and municipalities will draw up capacity development plans, based on simple and largely selfadministered needs assessments – linked explicitly to the outcomes of their respective MC/PM assessments. Responsibility for this will be assigned to DDC and municipal HR Development Units, which (on the basis of consultations) would draw up CD plans and submit them to advisory committees and councils for approval. Such CD plans will define the demand-driven dimension to local government capacity development. Sub-activities will consist of: • • • • • 4.5  Provide support to develop a CD planning methodology for LGs Support the HR Development Units in the DDCs to develop CD plans and use the CD grants Provide Training in LG CD planning processes Provide support to the HR unit of the DDCs and municipality and VDC CD functions Backstop LG CD planning activities Provide GE/SI core training services to LGs  This activity will support to design a core, supply-driven, capacity development programme for local governments. This will be rolled out across the country, using (wherever possible) qualified service providers as trainers. Core training services will be defined, procured and monitored/supervised by MLD as part of its overall National Capacity Development Strategy for local governments (see LGCDP outputs 6 and 7). Core training will cover the “mandatory” CD menu for all LGs – and would constitute the supply-driven dimension to local government capacity development, and will encompasses areas where all (or most) LBs have special problems, which are likely to impact negatively on the implementation or increase fiduciary risks, such as financial management and procurement. A number of core standard training modules will be elaborated within generic administrative areas such as planning, budgeting, financial management, procurement and good governance and the programme. This initiative will be supported through MLD. Sub-activities will include: • Contract core CD service providers • Supervise activities of CD service providers • Monitor and evaluate performance of CD service providers 4.6  Provide core capacity-building to local level line departments to deliver public services  This activity will support to design a core capacity development programme for local line departments to deliver public services. It will help building capacity of other potential actors at the local level. Subactivities will include: 35  • • • • 4.7  Review interactions between line-departments and core administration at the DDC level Elaborate training materials on these issues Support line departments (HR, etc.) Provide standard training for all DDCs and VDC secretaries Provide core training services to community organisations, user groups and other local service delivery (production) agencies (including private /SME sector)  User groups, community organisations and the private sector will also be involved in the “production” of public goods and services. This activity will strengthen their capacity in service delivery at local level. Sub-activities will include: • Elaborate training materials on various forms of service delivery production (planning, budgeting, implementation, M&E etc.) for COs, user groups and private contractors • Support training of these providers (contracted NGOs and private companies 4.8  Design standard training modules for the demand side training  Standard training curricula will be prepared to provide training to the service providers at local level including certification process. Sub-activities will include: • Prepare core training curricula • Define certification process for service providers 4.9.  Capacity building of Interim Local Bodies and officials  LGCDP will provide Interim Local Bodies and officials with appropriate capacity building in order to strengthen their ability to provide adequate oversight. Output 5. Local governments service delivery mechanisms and processes fine­tuned   Although LGCDP constitutes a national programme, the programme will nonetheless retain a capacity to fine-tune a range of systems, procedures and processes – with a view to having such pilots scaled up at a later date. To implement pilot activities, LGCDP will establish special implementation and monitoring arrangements, inter alia: • •  A small and dedicated field team, responsible for establishing, supporting and monitoring pilots. This sub-team of LGCDP will closely coordinate its activities with MLD and any LGCDP technical advisers; and A coherent geographical zone of intervention for all pilot activities (for example, six Districts in a single Region) so as to minimise costs associated with intensive support, supervision and monitoring.  A basic LB reporting system for physical progress reports will be elaborated during the Approach Period. Fine-tuning and piloting will be undertaken in a number of areas, as described in the set of indicative activities below. 36  5.1  Update PEM and PFM systems and procedures  Whilst LSGA and its related regulations do provide a relatively comprehensive framework for local level planning and public expenditure and financial management, there are a number of areas that require a certain amount of fine-tuning in order to develop optimal arrangements. Piloting and fine-tuning of PEM/PFM processes will be expanded to include local government monitoring, evaluation and reporting systems. It should also include piloting of alternative ways for VDCs (other than from their DDC) to access technical support in order to implement investment subprojects. LGCDP will therefore undertake the following sub-activities: • • • •  Fine tune procurement and implementation procedures Fine tune bottom-up planning & budgeting procedures Fine tune Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and asset management procedures Fine tune social inclusion mechanisms (dalit, women and DAG committees) in planning and budgeting systems • Fine tune resource sharing mechanism • Fine tune LG reporting, monitoring and evaluation systems • Prepare reporting, monitoring and evaluation software  5.2  Test safety net and social assistance programmes  LGCDP will pilot VDC administration and management of safety net and social assistance programmes to provide the ultra-poor with opportunities to build up assets and to address inter-generational human development challenges (e.g. education, health). The type of social assistance programmes to be piloted will be cash transfer systems – both targeted/non-targeted and conditional/unconditional. The cash transfer programmes will be clearly separated from social mobilisation, although they will include a strong element of local community-level oversight. Safety net programme will address immediate needs of the disadvantaged groups as identified and prioritised by their COs. Specific sub-activities will consist of: • • • • • 5.3  Carry out scoping study for safety net and social assistance programmes Design safety net programme pilot Implement safety net pilot in selected VDCs Monitor and evaluate safety net pilot Adjust design and implement Pilot sector support (e.g. education, health, etc.) at the local level  In order to inform national policies on sector devolution, the programme will trial the use of conditional sector grants (in the fields of education/health/agriculture) in a limited number of DDCs. With regard to the piloting of sector support at the local level, LGCDP will focus on the agriculture, health and education sectors (all of which are nominally devolved). Sector conditional grants would be made to DDCs, which will then undertake joint planning and budgeting exercises with District education, health and other offices. Very importantly, sector conditional grants will not be limited to capital expenditures, but will also be used for financing operational development expenditures (e.g. travel 37  allowances, DSA, equipment, etc.) on the basis of GON budget norms. The design and implementation of these grants will be done in close collaboration with the respective sectors and will fit into the elaboration of sector devolution guidelines. This will involve the following set of sub-activities: • • • •  Carry out scoping study for sector conditional grants Design sector conditional grant pilot in close cooperation with the line ministries (LMs) Implement sector conditional grant pilot Monitor and evaluate sector conditional grant pilot and provide input to policy development (output 6) • Prepare guidelines for comprehensive devolution  5.4  Test DDC local development coordination functions (line agencies, NGOs, etc.)  A final area for LGCDP fine-tuning concerns will be DDC coordination of sector line agencies, NGOs and donor-supported projects. Although this is mandated by LSGA, there is considerable variation in the effectiveness and quality of DDC coordination. The programme will therefore pilot innovative mechanisms by which DDCs can fulfil their coordination functions. The testing out of DDC coordination functions would examine options for facilitating inter-sectoral planning, involving NGOs and the private sector in local development activities, etc. This will include institutional mapping exercises, establishing forums for coordination, and developing template agendas for coordination events. Sub-activities will be: • • • • • •  Identify coordination needs and mechanisms Design improved coordination mechanisms Support implementation of improved coordination mechanisms Monitor and evaluate DDC coordination activities Assign tasks to divisions, sectors and officials Evaluate performance on the basis of satisfactory tasks completion and quality of work standards • Activate sectoral agencies effectively and accountably  Component  3:  Strengthened  policy  and  national  institutional  framework  for  devolution and local self­governance  A combination of enhanced citizen voice, greater community engagement with local government, increased fiscal resources at the local level, and local government capacity building will certainly make a significant contribution towards poverty reduction and better public services. However, there are also steps/actions to be taken at the policy and national levels which would further enhance programme impact. These are covered in two outputs under this component.  38  Output 6.    Policy  framework  for  decentralisation  promoted  a  more  enabling  environment for effective, transparent and accountable local governance   Delivering this output will enable LGCDP to provide a more effective policy framework within which local governance and local government can function. Given the evolving nature of local governance policy in the country, the activities for this output are inevitably indicative and of a “process” character. 6.1  Review decentralisation and sector devolution policy  Sector devolution policy will be prepared thorough review of existing policy frameworks and by engaging line ministries. An updated policy framework for decentralisation will be helpful to move towards local governance SWAp. The linkages with the work under the State Restructuring Committee will be closely maintained in the process. Sub-activities will include: • Review previous policies on decentralisation • Elaborate overall sector policy for decentralisation • Elaborate sector devolution guidelines (including procedures for HR/staffing, funding flows, functional assignment and linkages with civil society etc.) in close interaction with line ministries • Prepare local government audit strategy • Prepare a national framework for child-friendly local government 6.2  Establish decentralisation SWAp  In addition to contributing towards a more enabling policy framework for local governance, LGCDP will strengthen national capacities to support and monitor local governments through donor harmonisation to internalise the Paris Declaration. Sub-activities will be: • • • • • • • • • • • 6.3  Review all development partners’ funding within decentralisation sector Establish system for meetings between development partners and GON Ensure linkages to decentralisation policy (and the policy components in 6.1 ) Develop investment plan for the decentralisation sector linked to GON´s budget Establish systems and procedures for up-date of the annual work plans and budgets Develop aligned procedures for development partners modalities Prepare joint funding arrangements (studies, reviews, initiatives to strengthen GON systems) Develop results framework (see under M&E) Develop reporting systems for the use of funds Conduct orientation/training on SWAp Provide GON officials (MLD, etc.) with exposure to experience with SWAp Prepare more effective policy environment for “demand” side of local governance  Preparing a more enabling environment for the “demand” side of local governance will be an invaluable complement to “supply” side policy thinking. Lessons learned from the programme – which will include innovative ways of enhancing transparency and accountability – would inform “demand” side policy thinking. This activity will also include a thorough review of the constraints (e.g. access to information) to community engagement with local governments. Sub-activities will be: • Review existing policies and programme experiences 39  • Elaborate policy and guidelines on demand side of local governance and disseminate 6.4  Prepare improved staffing policies for local governments  Through this activity, LGDP will seek to create a more stable and effective staffing system for local governments. This is of added importance given the ongoing absence of elected bodies. Close linkages will be maintained with other agencies in the process - such as the involvement of MoGA, articulation with other ongoing reform processes and the like. The staffing policy will incorporate GE/SI issues and will be in line with the GON’s commitment for 33% women representation at all levels of the government. Sub-activities will include • • • • 6.5  Support development of appropriate staffing policy for key seconded civil servants Support establishment of performance-linked incentives for seconded and local staff Support policy thinking on local service arrangements and preparation of Local Service Act Support development of appropriate arrangements (salary scales, job descriptions, recruitment procedures, etc.) for local government staff Prepare National Capacity Development Strategy for local governments  Through this activity, LGCDP will support the formulation and implementation of a nation-wide and sustainable capacity development strategy for local governments, to be overseen by the government and implemented by the government through training institutions, regional workshops/training events, private consultants, other development partners etc. The development of a national capacity building strategy for local governments will take into account the MC/PM system, the need to avoid any monopoly over the provision of training services, the role of LB associations (ADDCN, MUAN, NAVIN) and a range of other factors. Sub-activities will include: • Outsource resource centres for CD strategy preparation • Support development of CD Strategy and framework, including elements of the activity 4.1. 6.6  Conduct outcomes and impact studies of local governance and community development programmes and outputs (evidence-based policy-making)  MLD will carry out outcomes and impact studies of community development programmes, including those involving local body grants as well as resources used by communities and document the results of the study. Such studies will be aimed at informing an evidence-based policy process and will not be limited to community development. Much can be learned from other types of projects, both in Nepal and elsewhere. The sub-activities will be: • Outsource for conducting studies on the outcomes and impacts of the various components and outputs of the programme and other related programmes • Conduct action research for the improvement of devolution process to foster local selfgovernance • Document and publish outcomes and impacts in MLD annual reports  40  6.7  Fine-tuning of local government infrastructure and service delivery mechanisms and processes informs national policy processes  Lessons from pilot activities will be of fundamental importance to policy processes. LGCDP will ensure, through good coordination, that the experience gained through pilot and fine-tuning activities across the spectrum of the programme is fed into policy analysis and thinking. This highlights the need for pilots to be carefully/effectively monitored and properly documented. • Monitor and document lessons learned from Output 3 and 5 activities 6.8.  Policy review and action plan regarding sector devolution  The programme will support MLD and other ministries in reviewing sector devolution policies and in drawing up an action plan for sector devolution. Output 7.    Capacity of central government and national non­government institutions  strengthened  to  provide  appropriate  support  to  local  governments  is  enhanced   In addition to contributing towards a more enabling policy framework for local governance, LGCDP will also strengthen national capacities to support and monitor local governments. Indicative activities for this output include: 7.1  Provide support for GON local governance policy analysis and policy making functions  As MLD and other Central Government institutions (e.g. MoF and NPC) strengthen their ability to monitor local government performance, LGCDP will provide appropriate technical assistance aimed at strengthening more evidence-based and analytical policy-making. Without line ministries developing a capacity to fully understand and articulate sector devolution principles, they will be unlikely to make a useful contribution to policy making in the area of decentralisation. Support for policy analysis and policy making functions will be extended to include the important line ministries that are responsible for the delivery of basic public services. Sub-activities will include: • Build capacity of MLD, MoF, line ministries, NPC,PMO and other central government officials • Support MLD’s Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) and enhance its capacities to coordinate and replicate decentralisation and local governance support activities • Provide technical assistance and advisory services • Support development of social mobilisation policy • Support development of policies and procedures for donor harmonisation • Support policy processes (e.g. consultations with ADDCN, MuAN and NAVIN) 7.2  Provide support to LBFC  The Local Bodies’ Fiscal Commission (LBFC) should play an important advisory role with respect to fiscal decentralisation issues and the provision of performance based block grants. The support to LBFC should be extended to include special support for the elaboration and fine-tuning of grant allocation formula, and support to LBFC to enable the Commission to play an active role in the expenditure and revenue assignment and revenue mobilisation activities, review and piloting of PFM procedures (including accounting systems).  41  To enable LBFC to play this role effectively, LGCDP will undertake a range of sub-activities, as follows: • Provide technical assistance in defining LBFC role, functions and composition and linkages with other institutions • Provide training and capacity-building to LBFC officials • Support LBFC functioning within important areas such as studies, coordination, networking (e.g. with other fiscal commissions and related institutions), advising, assessments, monitoring, etc. • Provide support to development of an intergovernmental fiscal grant and development grant policies, an up-date of the fiscal decentralisation road map, and emerging fiscal frameworks within the context of the state restructuring • Support annual reviews of the development of fiscal decentralisation policy • Support operationalisation of the new role assigned to the LBFC with respect to annual assessments of LBs performance (MC/PM system) • Support follow-up and update the refinement and implementation of selected recommendations from the LBFC 7.3  Provide support to LB associations (ADDCN, MuAN, and NAVIN)  Substantial support will be provided to LB associations to enhance their role in key policy discussions with government in terms of analysis and recommendations for local bodies’ budget transfers as well as capacity building issues. The LB associations will have a major role to play in capacity building and dissemination of information to their members on local governance issues, including LGCDP activities. The sub-activities will be: • Assess capacity of the LB associations • Support the LB associations – ADDCN, MuAN and NAVIN within their core areas such as policy development/advocacy/development of governance policies and support to regulations, capacity building of members LBs and quality support, dissemination, knowledge and learning share 7.4  Support implementation of National Capacity Development Strategy for local governments  Through this activity, LGCDP will support the formulation and implementation of a nation-wide and sustainable capacity development strategy for local governments, to be overseen by the government and implemented by the government through training institutions, regional workshops/training events, private consultants, other development partners etc. Provision of support for the implementation of a national capacity building strategy for local governments will include a review of how MLD currently provides local bodies with capacity building services. This will also examine (among other things) the ability of the current HR sections/units to handle these services. Consideration will also be given to the role that LB associations can be expected to play in the implementation of capacity building activities aimed at their respective memberships. Subactivities will include: • Support MLD’s HR development • Identify qualified CD service providers  42  7.5  Design and implement MLD LG performance monitoring and evaluation system  This activity will seek to improve the quality and extent to which MLD monitors local government performance – which is an essential prelude to MLD being able to provide appropriate support. There is an urgent need to focus on improving on the existing M&E system for both financial and physical reporting12. The physical reporting system, in particular, is – for all intents and purposes – non-existent at VDC and DDC levels and therefore considerable effort will be put into building up a practical and useable set of guidelines for physical output reporting from the VDC/DDC levels. This activity will also address the skills gaps. Sub-activities will include: • • • •  Review and design monitoring indicators, encompassing the results of the MC/PM system Build capacity of the MLD monitoring team in results-based monitoring Organise training on results-based monitoring Prepare LG reporting system – fiscal as well as physical output progress reports in cooperation with other agencies, particularly MoF and NPC • Review/refine LB reporting system • Support Decentralised Management Information System (DMIS) development and functioning in MLD and linkage to Decentralised Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System (DPMAS)  7.6  Mainstream gender equality (GE) and social inclusion (SI) and child/youth inclusion (CYI) in MLD activities  This LGCDP activity will contribute to strengthening MLD's capacity to mainstream GE/SI issues into any and all support that it provides to local governments. A GE/SI Section will be established in the MLD. GE/SI focal person will be identified in the DDCs and GE/SI responsive planning system will be introduced. Municipalities and VDCs will be encouraged to follow GE/SI friendly programmes. Such affirmative action measures will have a tangible impact on local expenditure patterns (more towards activities favoured by these groups) and in building social acceptance of women, and excluded groups. They also provide opportunities for women and the excluded to assert their leadership and managerial skills and challenge patriarchal and feudal mindsets. A range of sub-activities will be undertaken: • • • • • • • •  Restructure MLD Establish GE/SI section in MLD and identify GE/SI focal person in DDCs Support GON’s gender responsive budget system Train staff in GE/SI /CYI related issues for better and GE/SI sensitive budgeting, planning and monitoring Review institutional arrangements for implementation of GESI/CYI strategies Implement MLD GE/SI /CYI strategy Review possibilities for strengthening of MLD’s support role in this area vis-à-vis LBs. Support for the development of a GE/SI sensitive staffing policy for key civil servants.  12  In addition, in order to contribute to the inclusiveness aspect of the Program outcome, the Program will focus on ensuring that monitoring mechanisms include a system for reporting back to the community right holders (especially disadvantaged groups, including children, young people, and women) through the means of public/social auditing that would hopefully enable them to initiate and influence decisions.  43  7.7 Organise capacity building programme for decentralisation focal units of various line ministries including NPCS, MoF, PMO, MoGA, MoWC&SW, MoE, MoHP, MoAC and others Capacity building support will be provided to the line ministries and National Planning Commission Secretariat (NPCS) to enable them to support GON’s local governance policy. Capacity building for decentralisation focal points in local body associations and line ministries will be undertaken to ensure that the principles of decentralisation and sector devolution are internalised. This will, inter alia, also ensure greater coordination of key sector reforms and the overall decentralisation reform process. Major sub-activities will be: • • • • • • 7.8  Establish contacts and organise meeting of focal points Assess core areas for capacity building Prepare course manuals Outsource capacity building to appropriate agencies Conduct CD programmes Support central level agencies in important areas such as studies, coordination, networking (e.g. with other international institutions), advising, assessments, monitoring, etc. Provide FCGO, OAG and ICAN with capacity building support  Capacity of the FCGO, OAG and ICAN will be strengthened under the programme with a focus on outreach not only to DDC level but also VDC level13, elaboration of audit guidelines, training of the OAG in new tools and programmes, including the MC/PM system, procurement regulations, accounting systems, etc. The sub-activities will be: • Review FCGO/OAG/ICAN local government audit capacities • Provide FCGO/OAG/ICAN with capacity building services 7.9.  Provide support for policy coordination and exposure  Through this activity, LGCDP will support a range of initiatives (workshops, study tours, forums, etc.) aimed at helping the Government to coordinate its sector devolution policy Output 8.    Support provided for programme implementation   This output will deal with the management and programme implementation. Major sub-activities will be: • Review the organisation of MLD, the structures and the links with LGCDP • Recruit core technical support staff • Ensure basket funds for procurement of short term TA • Provide logistical support to MLD • Establish linkages to specific non-MLD project management functions • Ensure funding for all staff contracted for SM • Train MLD core responsible staff in all aspects of project management, community development and local governance etc. 8.1  Approach Period (June – July 15, 2008)  13  It is not expected that OAG will carry out all the audits but be more involved in quality assurance and oversight.  44  The MLD and its DPs will undertake a range of preparatory activities from June to July 15, 2008 prior to the launch of the programme. The following activities will be carried out during approach period Activity 1. Conduct institutional analysis of the MLD capacity to review preparedness of MLD to perform the tasks and to deliver the capacity building support required in the short to medium term, and suggest recommendations including action plan. 2. Review the options for physically housing the new Programme Coordination Unit (PCU) team and other support staff. 3. Prepare a common physical reporting system (including standardised reporting formats) for block grant allocations and guidelines for the utilisation of DDC grants (which will start flowing from FY 2008/09). 4. Conduct socio-economic and environmental impact assessment. (There is particularly a need to elaborate clear and simple checklists for LBs preparations of projects and to describe the legal and regulatory framework and practices within these areas.) 5. Prepare fund flow agreements and the Joint Financing Agreement (JFA) for SWAp. 6. Reach agreements with DPs that can finance the costs of the Approach Period and support start-up activities in a flexible, rapid and smooth manner. 7. Review and analysis of the findings from the planned UNCDF funded VDC block grant study. 8. Work on the topping up grants strategy 9. Prepare and/or review the set of conditions to determine which local body (as well as community organization) can be taken on board for the pilot exercise so that Program outcomes can be attained 10. Prepare AWPB for the first year of LGCDP (drawing up a detailed annual plan and budget for the first year of LGCDP implementation including timing, sequencing and prioritisation of various activities). 11. Elaborate verifiable indicators for the LOGFRAME and design a monitoring and results framework for the entire programme – matrix and indicators, based on the LOGFRAME. 12. Prepare procurement plans and ToRs for core and other TA. 13. Advertise for long and short term TA and conduct interviews of core staff 14. Establish the Consultative/Advisory Committee with agreements on ToR, working modalities and decision-making procedures. 15. Start preparation of operational manual for the entire programme  Support Agency DfID  UNCDF Other UN agencies ADB  NORAD MLD and UNCDF UNCDF Danida World Bank  MLD SDC GTZ UN agencies/CIDA UN agencies MLD in cooperation with the DPs MLD MLD in cooperation with UN agencies  45  8.2  Inception Phase (July 16, 2008 – January 2009)  As LGCDP represents a move towards a completely new system of development support for local governance and community development and entails an innovative articulation of the demand and supply sides, it is important that the programme is flexible, especially in the Inception Phase. The following activities will be carried out during the Inception Phase: • Establish the PCU closely integrated into MLD, and related management arrangements. • Conduct a base-line study of the situation within the LBs and community organisations (level of performance, challenges and constraints). • Up-date the implementation and procurement plans. • Develop operational manuals for all critical areas, particularly SM and the grant support outputs/activities. • Start the topping up of DDC block grants, preparation of the expansion of the VDC block grants (to start with a rolling out from second half of the first Year) and subsequently preparation of the grants to municipalities (to start from FY 2009/10). • Provide support for the fine-tuning of PFM/PEM procedures. • Assess the degree to which existing financial management processes and protocols are adequate to ensure financial accountability of local governments (and, where necessary, of community organization as well). • Start up capacity building activities and TA backstopping for MLD and prepare such support for the LBs, including preparation of the demand side based CB grants. Provide general mandatory training to LBs. • Develop a package of pilots and experimentation that could be applied in to give greater voice to community groups in needs prioritization as well as access to resources. • Carry out a joint DP-GON review (to adjust the programme). • Organises monthly meetings with the DPs supporting LGCDP in order to coordinate activities, particularly the CB support. • Momentum of existing program (DFDP and DLGSP) will continue (maximum 6 months) under the umbrella of LGCDP until the new program is commenced, and phase out of these programs will be done during the Inception Phase. LGCDP/MLD will utilize resources and logistics of these programmes to achieve the goals mentioned in this document. All the assets of these programmes will be handed over to LGCDP. • Review the existing lessons learned from the various SM approaches. Develop a common understanding of LGCDP’s community participation and social mobilisation strategy, including specific activities, coverage, phasing and exit strategy (UNDP, WB, DFID, SDC, GTZ, CIDA) • Based on social mobilisation study and strategy develop guidelines for community participation in local decision making structures, such as councils and committees (MLD). • Develop a GE/SI strategy, with results statements and indicators explicitly spelt out as per the Log Frame (CIDA, GTZ). • Review and design the detailed modalities for the LG&AF (Danida/CIDA)  4   Programme Management    4.1   National level   The programme will be executed by the Ministry of Local Development. MLD will take overall responsibility for the programme and establish a high level government National Advisory Committee (NAC) for overall coordination, policy advocacy and supervision of the programme, as 46  well as for making strategic recommendations concerning its implementation. This National Advisory Committee will be chaired by the Secretary (MLD) and will consist of the MLD’s Joint Secretaries, DG DoLIDAR, representatives of relevant Line Ministries and representatives of development partners. The Secretary, MLD will appoint the Joint Secretary, Local Governance Coordination Division as National Programme Director (NPD) of the LGCDP, who will act as Member-Secretary for the committee. The committee will meet at least twice a year. 4.1.1  National Advisory Committee  MLD Secretary  -  Chairperson  MLD Joint Secretaries  -  Member  Sectoral ministries’ representatives (Joint Secretary Level)  -  Member  Representatives from MOF NPC, FCGO and OAG  -  Member  DG, DoLIDAR  -  Member  Donor representatives  -  Member  Local Bodies Associations' Representatives (ADDCN, MuAN, NAVIN)  -  Member  National Programme Director, LGCDP  -  Member-Secretary  4.1.2  Programme Coordination Unit  The LGCDP Programme Coordination Unit (PCU) will be established as a programme unit under the Local Governance Coordination Division of MLD (Annex 3) and will ensure the internal coordination of policy activities related to LGCDP through the Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) that already exists within MLD. LGCDP will be managed on a full-time basis by an Under Secretary from MLD, acting as Programme Manager (PM) and heading the PCU regularly, who reports through the Joint Secretary/NPD to the MLD Secretary and to the NAC. DPD will be accountable to NPD and will be involved in daily supervision. Within the PCU there will be specific, dedicated, Output Managers for each of the Programme outputs, selected from amongst the various section chiefs who will be PCU members. This will introduce a degree of accountability internally in MLD in terms of result based output management. The diagram on the next page provides a suggested allocation of output responsibilities to various MLD sections. PCU/Output Managers will meet monthly to discuss issues regarding programme implementation and the PCU will prepare trimesterly progress reports. The PCU will prepare annual work plans and budgets (AWPB) and present them to the PCC. The AWPB will be linked to GON systems and based on LSGA/LBFAR. Furthermore, the PCU will be responsible for drawing up Procurement Plans in accordance with the 2007 Procurement Act and Regulations. The PCU technical cell will include a full-time national team leader cum decentralization and local governance specialist and other national specialists such as i) local government capacity building, ii) local government finance, iii) financial management, iv) social mobilisation and accountability, v) 47  GE/SI, vi) M&E, vii) MIS/GIS and communications (see the table below)14. These technical specialists will work under the under the daily supervision of the national team leader who will be accountable to PM. PM will be accountable and report to NPD. They will provide technical assistance and support to the Output Managers. The new recruitment process, will take place within the inception phase. In addition to the full-time national team leader, technical specialists, the PCU could also draw on international expertise to provide exposure to national and international good practice and technical core expertise. The PCU team and other support staff will be housed in MLD premises. PCU can decide to draw technical assistance as and when necessary. The PCU will also include (at least for the first two years of programme implementation) two management specialists/advisers. One would provide MLD with support to undertake procurement activities (according to the provisions of the 2007 Procurement Act and related regulations). The other would provide MLD’s General Administration Division with support for LGCDP-related financial management (consolidated reports, withdrawal applications, etc.). The meetings of the output managers will be held at least once a month.

A separate liaison and network will be developed during inception phase to assure effective coordination and efficiency of the LGCDP implementation. Sections in bold denotes output management responsibilities. Programme Manager will coordinate all Output Managers and sections. It is expected that the responsibility areas will be further broken down under the Output Managers incorporating all relevant sections working under MLD. LBFC will coordinate the activities within the area of local governance finance including MC/PM system, revenue studies. GE/SI section will be linked to Community Participation, Social Mobilization and policy. Further elaboration and adjustments will be done based on MLD’s intuitional assessment. The PCC may decide to establish regional liaison offices to provide implementation and monitoring support for the programme.  49  Table 1:  Indicative TA needs  The table below provides a summary of LGCDP’s indicative TA needs for PCU: Outputs Outputs 1 and 2  Technical Assistance 1 SM Nat.

The LGCDP activities will be integrated into the local bodies’ plans and DDC/municipal/VDC councils will approve LGCDP action plans at respective levels. A maximum of 7% of the block grants should be earmarked by DDC, 5% municipalities and VDCs to finance investment servicing costs (contracting of short term contracted support staff (minimum one person will be recruited but not permanent employees), consultants, NGOs, etc). Recruitment/procurement processes for this should be transparent and subject to appropriate checks and balances. Of the 7 %, for DDCs, each DDC should earmark about 2% (according to guidelines) for support to VDCs in areas such as planning, appraisal, and financial management and monitoring. DDC will have rights to recruit one District Programme Facilitator as per its existing recruiting system however the qualification will be set by National Advisory Committee. The DDCs, municipalities and the VDCs will receive substantial capacity building support from the supply driven training organised by the central government as well as the demand driven capacity building grants to be designed (as part of output 4). To the extent possible, the Program will also seek to ensure that such capacity building support can be utilized by community groups.  5.   Implementation Modality  50  MLD will be responsible for policy level interventions as well as coordination with other ministries. PCU will be responsible for the outputs of the LGCDP where as Local Bodies will be for responsible for local level implementation.  5.1   Implementation Arrangements   LGCDP activities will be implemented by local bodies through user committees/school management committees/health management committees etc., community organisations, federations of community organisations (e.g. CMCs), cooperatives, local NGOs, line agencies and public-private-partnership arrangements. 5.1.1  Towards a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp)  MLD intends to move towards a sector wide approach (SWAp) to manage the local governance sector, rather than having a series of projects with their own funding, management, implementation, and reporting arrangements. Key features of sector wide management, which will be developed and introduced during LGCDP, are: a) The provision of a single clear sector policy and strategic framework that links the sector policies and the LGCDP including the expenditure plans for the sector, so that the allocation of resources reflects the priorities for the sector. b) Annual programme and budget which specify the activities to be carried out under each strategic objective and by department/divisions/local bodies. c) Reporting on activities and performance indicators against the plan, with common reporting and performance monitoring arrangements (rather than each funding and supporting agency having its own review process and missions). It is expected that as local governance sector reform progress and experience is gained in operating a sector management approach, a rising share of the external support will be provided through pooled funding and on the basis of common procedures (including financial management). MLD and DPs aim to sign a Letter of Intent by June 2008 and Joint Financial Agreement by the end of Year One15 in order to operationalise harmonisation initiatives. This will include agreement about the role (within overall DPs assistance) of the programme partners with their related funding mechanisms, at both national as well as district, municipal and VDC level. It will address the issues of the extent to which (and within what timeframe) MLD will be able to take responsibility for implementation of all programmes and projects. At this stage DPs may continue to provide support in kind (TA, commodities, and equipment) or in the form of earmarked grants for specified activities or budget items. However, it is envisaged that all DPs and other external sources will provide the necessary information on allocations, which will then be reflected in the GON budgetary system. MLD’s Local Governance Division, in collaboration with the Planning and Foreign Aid Coordination Division, will take the lead in documenting current DPs disbursement and reporting arrangements and those of government, and explaining how they fit together in order to guide harmonisation.  15  The Letter of Intent will also include how EDPs will provide support in the short term prior to adoption of full SWAp.  51  On commencement of LGCDP, MLD will work with DPs to review each externally supported project, in order to gauge consistency with the priorities and activities of the LGCDP and to agree on any necessary modifications to DPs support. There are three major management changes envisaged during the implementation of the LGCDP. These are: a. b. c.  MLD taking responsibility for implementation of projects currently managed by the DPs (and their contracted agencies). Decentralisation with clear performance management arrangements. MLD and DoLIDAR moving towards a facilitator/financier and policy making role  5.1.2   Participatory Planning Process based on LSGA  The participatory planning process as provided for by the LSGA will be followed (Annex 4). COs and their federation/cooperatives will be involved in the participatory planning process. Participation of women, dalit and janajatis will be mandatory in the process. 5.1.3  Financial Management  The LSGA, LBFAR, LSGR will together be the basis for fund flows to local bodies, as well as for programme and budget management. Accounting and auditing of local bodies will be maintained as per LSGA and LBFAR. MLD will follow central level financial regulations of GON, whereas, the local bodies will follow the Local Bodies Financial Administration Regulations 2064. An assessment will be carried out to ascertain the degree to which existing financial management processes and protocols are adequate to ensure financial accountability of local governments (and, where necessary, of community organization as well). 5.1.3.1 Funds Flow    LGCDP National Advisory Committee will approve the annual indicative plan and block grant allocations of the programme. The following funds flow mechanisms will be adopted in the LGCDP. a. Fund flow and funding mechanisms will be according to the JFA and programme implementation guidelines. b. Programmes and budget of the LGCDP will be incorporated into the Annual Budget (Redbook) of the GON. GON, as well as donor agencies’ resources, will be released to the District Development Fund (DDF) and Municipal Development Fund (MDF) from the Central Treasury. The DDC will then facilitate the release of funds to the Village Development Fund (VDF) and/or CDF or CBOs and then to the communities. c. Top up grants will be blended together with the GON block grant in the form of capacity development grants and capital expenditure grants. A minimum of thirty-three percent of the VDC capital expenditure will be allocated to projects selected by disadvantaged groups ), including available for use by community groups to strengthen their own capabilities  52  d. For the expanded block grant (topping up), one common consolidated system for the flow of funds through the National Treasury system (FCGO – DTCO - LBs) will be used for all funds, thereby enabling a blend of funds from the outset, as well as consolidated reporting, monitoring and accountability. The systems and procedures for the flow of funds will be improved in the following areas: • Transfer of funds will be linked to submission of financial as well as physical output reports – no reports from the LBs will mean no future transfers until all problems have been resolved. • Support will be provided for strengthening LB audits and OAG capacity building, including support for the development of new audit guidelines for LBs. • Funds will be transferred in three equal instalments on condition that reports from the last fourmonthly period, but one, have been submitted correctly and on time. In FY 2008/09, the existing system will be applied. • Possibility of setting aside a given portion of the top-up grants received by local bodies to be used to experiment with innovative and flexible methods of service delivery and attaining the Program outcome The funding flow for the capacity building grant (from year 2 when it is up and running) will use the same route as the development block grants (i.e. through the national Treasury system). DPs and GoN will sign a JFA on the modalities for flow of funds, reporting, pledging of funds, etc. This will be done as soon as possible in the Approach Period and all parties should closely monitor the flow of funds, and take quick and firm actions in case of delays or irregularities. The system will be flexible and allow for change, if there are reasons for concerns and problems with the suggested modality. The DPs supporting the JFA will make funds available to GON through a foreign exchange account in the name of the MOF in the NRB, to be used exclusively to finance the Programme Funding to cover the costs of social mobilisation will go from the DPs to the MLD LGCDP Account and from there directly to the various local bodies and not be part of the block grant system as SM has to do with the demand, not supply, side. Funds for the VDCs will go through the DDC (see the figure below) to the VDF in the short term, until sufficient capacity is built up at the VDC level to handle direct transfers from the district treasury. Capacity will be targeted towards achieving this objective within the Programme period at a much earlier point of time. The coming VDC block grant studies would provide valuable guidance on where the bottlenecks are and how the system can be prepared so as to handle direct transfers to the VDCs while keeping the monitoring responsibilities of the DDCs intact.  53     Flow of Funds for Block Grants Cent  MOF  C op Autho y of risatio  ris a ti  ho  n  th o on  Aut  al ti o r i sa  In s  truc  n  Fun  ti o n  dF  DTCO  MLD  low F un d F  DDC  Reports  Municipality  Kha Accounts  Requ  Ka Accounts  etters est L  ts Repor  Fund Flow  Reports  Accounts that will not be zero at the FY end  DDF/MDF  Reports  Ga 4 Non-Operating Accounts GA 4.1 Current Account Reports  GA 4.2 Capital Account  GA 4.3  GA 4.4  GA 4.5  GA 4.6  Own Source Revenue  Revenue Sharing  Income / Loan from Donors  Internal Loan and Misc.

The LGCDP is seen as the first phase of a long term programme of support. Although Government structures and systems are likely to change over the coming years, LGCDP should be seen as the first phase of a longer term programme of support to local governance and community development strengthening both the demand and the supply sides of local service delivery and good governance. The table below provides an overview of the funding that is expected to be available for LGCDP from the various Development Partners. GON  Commitment USD 260.8 million  ADB  USD 66.5 million  Remarks DDC grant 20 million, Municipal grant 20 million and 188 million VDC grants (capital grants only for 4 years). Funding for the entire LGCDP, e.g. through a JFA (preferred). It is going to be in form of “programmatic” support, probably transferred in two instalments as budget support with some few conditions. A quick elaboration of a JFA is absolutely critical for the processing of the support. A part of this support will be earmarked for local peace committees. In addition to this support there is expected to be funds available for TA support to GE/SI.  16  Including $3 M to LPC to be channel through MOPR  56  DfID  USD 30 million  UN agencies  USD 25 million  CIDA  USD 11 million  Danida  USD 15 million  Government of Norway SDC  USD 10 million  GTZ  Euro 20 million (29.4 USD) (UDLE, PASRA and support to TDF) committed and already under implementation and additional 7.5 million Euro is under negotiation. Potential commitment to be defined  World Bank  USD 4 million  JICA  to be determined in amount  Government of Finland  to be determined in amount  Potential additional amount of USD 50 Million USD 30 million is the expected amount. DfID contribution is expected from the Programme start. Estimate: USD 25 million – the final figure committed. Of these expected USD 25 million, UNDP (USD 5 million, and UNCDF (USD 2 million) have already clarified their commitment. Other UN agencies are in a process of reviewing their ongoing activities and links to the LGCDP. About 11 million USD for the four years 2008-2012, i.e. 2-3 million annually. The funds can start being utilised from FY 2008/09 (2009) Funds will be available from January 2009. A smaller amount (< 0.5 million USD) will be available in 2008. USD 10 million with 2008 as the starting date. Expects about 4 million USD of which about 0.5 million USD could be spent in the coming FY (2008/09). Funding in the coming years will be as project support to specific activities coordinated with LGCDP. It is important to explore further exactly which of the existing budgets lines in the LGCDP can be taken on board/supported by the funding from GTZ and be an integrated part of the overall budget available for the activities.  The WB is considering support to local governance and community development, and planning is ongoing. In principle, the WB is positive towards a joint national LGCDP. At the moment, a clear commitment is not available and no decision has yet been taken about the future support and its modalities. Funds (realistic figure: 100 million US$) will be available if the programme is positively appraised by mid 2009, but will require significant planning and programming. Two TA support for capacity development of LBs and gender mainstreaming and social inclusion for FY 2008 with the potential to increase 2009 onwards) Support to programme framework  5.1.3.4 Funding Modalities   57  • Various funding modalities will be allowed, but with a view towards moving gradually into a genuine SWAp over the next 3-4 years. For the time being, all the DPs will provide support in a coherent, comprehensive and coordinated manner and fully aligned with LGCDP’s programmatic framework, thus reducing the overlaps, funding gaps and lack of coordination that have characterised the local governance and community-led development sector in the past. • The DPs and the GON would seek gradually to move towards harmonised and aligned procedures for support to LGCDP. During the first years, various modalities will co-exist, but it is important from the outset of the Programme to ensure strong coordination of the activities through monthly meetings between MLD and the DPs (led by MLD), through bi-annual joint reviews of the overall activities within LGCDP. ToRs for consultancies will be shared and coordinated to avoid overlap and to ensure sufficient synergies between various initiatives. • GON’s and LBs” audit procedures and systems will be applied, but will be allowed to make onthe-spot checks and audits in agreement with MLD and the OAG. • A JFA will be elaborated as soon as possible. The areas and DPs covered by the JFA should gradually expand as experience is gained and as trust is built up in the effectiveness of GON processes, supported by strong CB/TA in critical areas. • The following funding modalities will be applied in the programme period: i. Basket funding arrangement in the form of a JFA, with one budget funding flows. This JFA will particularly cover the flow of funds to blended GON block grants and topping-up of the block grants, but other areas may be considered as well; and the JFA will cover the support from those DPs which can apply JFA/basket fund arrangements, using GON procedures. ii. Basket funding TA arrangement will be managed in a joint MLD/UN system, using the mutually agreed National Implementation Guidelines. iii. DPs willing to fund special budget lines of LGCDP, but with strong coordination of the support to ensure synergies and complementarity, will be accommodated as per mutually agreed upon criteria between GON and DPs.  58  Modalities for Support to Local Governance and Community Development  Support outside of the JFA Basket Funding JICA GTZ  Specific support  JFA Basket Funding Aligned  Basket UN/CIDA Earmarked CB and TA  LGCDP  5.1.4  Monitoring and reporting  5.1.5.1 Monitoring   A performance monitoring and evaluation system will be developed as soon as possible. GE/SI issues will be integrated into the LG performance monitoring and evaluation system with inclusion of GE/SI sensitive indicators, gender and other socially disaggregated data. On-the-ground monitoring and mentoring will be done by a roving support & monitoring teams from the centre consisting of key MLD/PCU and line agency staff. These Teams will operate under the supervision of MLD and the central LGCDP team. These Teams will in principle comprise national specialists in local governance, social mobilization, local capacity building/planning, financial management and monitoring. These roving Teams will have a dual role: on one hand, providing support to local government and monitoring performance; on the other and, interacting with (and, in some cases, contracting), backstopping and monitoring the LBs, various NGOs and other social mobilisation agencies active in the area. Memorandum of understandings will be signed between MLD and DDCs/municipalities, which spell out their respective roles and responsibilities in LGCDP. The role of MLD will be supportive, coordinative, approval of AWPB, policy guidance, M&E, reporting and capacity development. Management guidelines will be developed for DDCs/municipalities. The Joint Annual Reviews (JAR) will be organised bi-annually, wherein GON and all development partners would participate. The first JAR (timing around November/December) will be the mechanism for proposing changes to the Programme document, in the implementation modalities etc. The JAR will be preceded by donor/Government assessments of implementation, systems, fact finding field visits, management issues etc. A second joint meeting will be conducted in May/June every year, when the annual work-plans, budgets, procurement plans and coordination of support and TA will be agreed upon. 59  Other monitoring will be done as below: Local level: • • • •  Monthly, trimesterly and annual programme reviews by PICs at the local bodies level, Public audit will be conducted at community level once a year, Social audit will be conducted at institutional level (i.e. local bodies) once a year, and Public hearing will be conducted by local bodies once a year.  MLD level • • •  Monthly/trimesterly and annual review by MLD, Mid-term review after eighteen months of implementation, and External review in the beginning of the fourth year of programme implementation.  5.1.5.2 Reporting   Reporting formats for the LGCDP will be developed and provided to all the local bodies at a very early stage. A robust system for physical progress reporting, linked to a facility/office in MLD, will be established - which consolidates reviews and follows up on reports. The progress, efficiency and effectiveness of the project will be planned and monitored through a regular reporting system as follows: • • •  Monthly reports Trimesterly progress reports Annual progress reports  The LGCDP will publish Annual Monitoring and Performance Reports that will include both physical and financial progress including major achievements. The Nepalese Fiscal Year will be followed for fund disbursement and progress reporting.  60  Figure 4: Overview of Upward Accountability Reporting System  MLD/PCU/N AC/M&E  6.   Fiduciary Risks   A recent review of overall Public Financial Management Performance in Nepal (PEFA – February 2008) suggests generally “high” fiduciary risks and indicates a number of areas in need of improvement. Among these areas are: (a) transparency in the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system; and (b) reporting and oversight on the part of various agencies, including the local bodies, which show very poor performance. An action plan has been drawn up and agreements reached to target the weaker PFM areas over the coming years that will be applicable to the LGCDP as well. The following are the fiduciary risks associated with LGCD Risks  1.  Viable and stable interim local councils are not established  Counter Measures  • •  Active measures will be taken at the VDC level to foster village level councils. If not established the project will continue to work through local government. Local pressure created through inbuilt Social Mobilization component within LGCDP and commitment expressed by the major 61  Risks  2.  Cultural and societal norms do not allow for social inclusiveness or gender sensitivity  Counter Measures  •  • 3.  Fund flow processes prove ineffective and inefficient  4.  Weak financial management capacity in MLD Weak financial management capability of community groups that are able to access a portion of the top-up grants  5.  6.

A number of other measures are in place, including social audit, public hearing, public disclose of LB performance etc. There is an increasing activism amongst marginalised groups to ensure “voice” – and this will be resisted with difficulty by local elites. In addition, this and other programmes will work hard to provide incentives for disadvantaged groups to voice themselves and to be heard. Civil society/community’s pressure to all the stakeholders will be inclusive through SM component SMs will receive training in these issues DPs through regular joint monitoring, feedback and reviews put pressure on the government. Mitigating measures and adjustment of funding flows may be considered, but the first step will be to strengthen the control and capacity of involved partiers in flow of funds. Technical Assistance will be provided for key areas There should be a system to ensure that prior to any communities being allocated any level of resources, there is not only an assessment of the capability to manage the resources, but also that there is a protocol in place to monitor such use Some part of the capacity development grant can be set aside for use by community groups so that they are better able to manage the resources that they would lay claim over Regular monitoring by local bodies would also help Support to OAG, development of LB audit guidelines, training, and support to system with QA of VDC audit. The MC/PM system promote LB incentives to follow-up on irregularities identified in the audit reports The MC/PM system promotes LB incentives to follow-up on irregularities identified in the audit reports. MCPM system will be continue at the DDC level; to be extended at municipal level; and DDC will introduce a simple mechanism of MCPM for VDC level (with the support of MLD); Internal audit system will be strengthened and audit report will be published for transparency. The MC/PM system promotes internal audit and has had an impact in the 20 districts where it has been piloted. Rolling out of the system is likely to improve financial management performance and internal audit, based on MTRs of DFDP and external fiduciary risks assessments (DFID, 2006). The new Procurement Act and Regulations are useful tools in strengthening of the public procurement Standards are set and in place by MLD Transparency in procurement ensured Training will be provided in application of the new Procurement Act 62  Risks  Counter Measures  • • 8.

LGCDP will react rapidly to any signs of undue staff turnover in local governments, as well as bolster the ability of local interim councils to insist on staff stability Regular review meeting between the DPs and MLD to minimise frequent staff transfers, backed by review of staff performance Training for staff will be conducted GON’s finances have improved now that the conflict has ended and donors are committed to providing assistance in the post-conflict period The Paris Declaration and commitment of some key development partners should mitigate against this Program adopts flexible approaches to accommodate different modalities or MLD allows DPs to operate within a framework. DPs will meet on a regular basic (monthly) with MLD to coordinate LGCDP. JFA will be elaborated and gradually expanded. The DPs have agreed to coordinate their capacity building support. MLD will take a strong lead in DP coordination. The MC/PM system promotes proper planning processes Most projects will be small scale projects without environmental impact Screening tools will be developed to ensure that the LBs considers this important issue in planning and implementation The MC/PM system should be up-dated annually to incorporate lessons learned and to further deepen and widen fiduciary safeguards as necessary. This should be combined with a major programme of supply- and demand-driven capacity building for the LBs (the AT endorses this part of the PD, but sufficient funds should be allocated to these important initiatives). It should be emphasized that the assessments should be done in an impartial, independent and external manner with a strong level of quality assurance. Support to FCGO, OAG, ICAN will be provided Support to improve reporting and monitoring systems  63  Annex 1  DAG VDC Mapping Criteria These ranking indicators are generated from analysis of the findings of the participatory DAG mapping by MLD in consultations with EDPs. As with the participatory indicators used in DAG mapping, these ranking indicators combine both economic and socio-cultural dimensions of DAG-ness. They are used together as a set to rank VDCs (or wards). Information is collected from readily available secondary sources. Criteria used are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.  HHs with food sufficient <3 months Concentration of marginalized HHs Access to primary school Access to health posts Participation of women, dalit and janajati in planning, execution and decisions making Prevalence of gender discrimination Prevalence of vulnerable HHs  (Note: Mapping will be done according to natural settlements and access of the inhabitants rather than limiting them within administrative demarcation of wards and VDCs.)  64  Indicators for ranking of VDCs and municipal wards by DAG-ness No.  Indicators  1  Food sufficiency of <3 months (concentration of daily-wage labourers, out-migration in search of labour, economic enslavement and bonded labour (kamaiya, hali, haruwa/charuwa)  2  Marginalized groups (such as Dalits, janajati, etc., resulting in socio-cultural discrimination, untouchability, verbal abuse, social exclusion in public gatherings and non-acceptability of ethnic cultures)  3  Lack of access (functional and responsive) to basic services: primary-level school and sub health post (deprivation and low affordability of basic services)  4  Low level of representation/participation of women, Dalits and janajati in formal decision-making bodies such as VDC, School Management Committees, Health Management Committees, local NGOs, etc. (lack of recognition of existence, lack of awareness of the rights of women and marginalized groups, illiteracy and low acceptability)  5  Prevalence of gender discrimination (such as early marriage, girls not sent to school, superstition of witch, violence against women, polygamy, polyandry, dowry, chaupadi (the practice of keeping women away from the house during pregnancy and delivery without proper care), parda (the practice of keeping women in a veil, etc.)  6  High prevalence of vulnerable groups such as victims of conflict (orphans, widows, single femaleheaded households, out-migration, etc.), trafficking, physical disability, natural calamities, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B etc.  65  Ranking indicator Indicator Food sufficiency of <3 months  Category of VDC 1. <10% 2. 10–25% 3. 26–40%  4.
