USAID: Climate Adaptation in Nepal's Himalayas
***** About Nepal *****
Landlocked between India and China, two rapidly changing countries, Nepal
remains one of the poorest countries in the world and continues to cope with
the effects of a decade-long insurgency that ended in 2006. Located in the
Himalaya mountain range, the country is greatly impacted by global climate
change and struggles with both water scarcity in some areas and increased
flooding in others. Supporting progress toward a democratic, resilient and
prosperous Nepal is a priority for U.S. development efforts.
USAID_programs_in_Nepal seek to reinforce recent gains in peace and security,
stabilize the transitional government, strengthen the delivery of essential
social services, expand proven health interventions, and address the global
challenges of food insecurity and climate change.
