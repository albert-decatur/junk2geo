***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
ADB's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nepal (2005 ? 2009) rests on three
pillars of which fostering inclusive social development is one. The three sub-
sectors prioritized under this pillar are (i) education, (ii) water supply,
sanitation and urban development, and (iii) social protection. While the
strategy emphasizes on building social protection initiatives within the
project design, it also identified the need to build capacity in social
protection institutions in Nepal. The CPS is in line with ADB's Strategy 2020,
which places emphasis on promoting greater access to opportunities by expanding
human capacities through investments in education, health and basic social
protections; as well as with the government's development strategy which has
been increasingly expressing its deep commitment to social justice and equity
and is striving to expand its safety net and social protection coverage. Nepal
has had in place an old-age pension scheme and benefits to widows and the
disabled since 1994. Since the current fiscal year, the government has expanded
this coverage by lowering the age limit and expanding its cash-transfer scheme
to certain caste/ethnic groups. The allowance has also been increased. However,
there are no child centered cash-transfer schemes at the moment despite strong
evidence that child protection measures can have significant impacts on the
health of children and their consequent contribution to society. Many studies
on early child brain development, including a study done by ADB shows that
child development is at the core of human development theory and that the most
critical period of brain development is in the first three years of life,
proper nutrition being a critical factor in healthy brain development. It is
estimated that more than half of Nepal's under-five children are stunted for
their age, and despite significant decrease in infant mortality rates, over
40,000 under-one children are still dying in Nepal every year. A study
conducted in 1999 revealed that of the 95,000 under-five child deaths in Nepal
every year, about 54% were attributed to moderate and severe malnutrition, with
the "moderates" responsible for most of the deaths. It has been proven that
mental stunting resulting from malnutrition is irreversible and the World Bank
estimated in 2007 that malnutrition in children in Nepal causes a GDP loss of
around 3% per year. Thus, studies have shown that the highest human capital
rates of return can be achieved from social protection targeting pre-school
children. Confounding to these problems is a recent food alert by the World
Food Programme in Nepal, warning of an impending food shortage, particularly in
the mid- and far-western hills of Nepal due to low winter precipitation.
Undoubtedly, children would be impacted the most. In 2008 UNICEF and WFP
conducted an exploratory survey to see how child benefit cash transfers would
be used by households. The study revealed that more than 40% of the money from
cash transfers to mothers would be spent on supplementary food for children,
around 30% on children's education and 11% or more on health care. Evidence
from another ADB project also demonstrated that women who were provided cash
transfers did have control over the money, and most of the allowance provided
to cover "basic needs" was spent on food, house maintenance, medicine,
education, clothing and household supplies, in that order of priority. Thus,
the justification to provide a monthly cash allowance and its direct relevance
to poverty reduction is more than evident for this project.
**** Impact ****
Reduction in child malnutrition in the project districts
**** Project Outcome ****
Description of Outcome
Enhanced execution of social protection programs
**** Implementation Progress ****
Description of Project Outputs
Enhanced capacity of local bodies in the project districts to deliver the child
grant Enhanced capacity of the government to design efficient and evidence-
based social protection programs Enhanced networking between local bodies,
health facilities, and communities in the project districts for improving child
nutrition
Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress
Output: Enhanced capacity of local bodies in the project districts to deliver
the child grant - Social protection Officers (SPOs) mobilized at the districts
since December 2012. However, currently, there is only one SPO remaining. The
EA is in the process of filling the vacancies. - In case of social protection
volunteers (SPVs), although the contract was signed on 23 January 2014, failure
of the recruited firm to perform well has led to the cancellation of the
contract. The EA is in the process of formalizing the cancellation. -
Management Information Specialists (MIS) contract signed on 23 January 2014.
Output 2: Enhanced capacity of the government to design efficient and evidence-
based social protection programs - A 2-day orientation and sharing workshop was
conducted for local development officers and SPOs from five project districts
and governance officers from UNICEF's mid- and far- western regional office. A
7-day capacity building training on social protection is also undertaken. - On
finalization of National Social Protection Framework, the consulting firm has
submitted the draft report. Comments on the draft report provided. - Manual on
cash transfer completed (child grant operations manual consolidated into one
comprehensive social protection operations manual) Output Enhanced networking
between local bodies, health facilities, and communities in the project
districts for improving child nutrition: - 1,169 FCHVs and 436 health facility
staff trained. - Midline survey completed. Preliminary results are showing
positive impacts of the child grant in the five project districts.
**** Safeguard Categories ****
Environment: C
Involuntary Resettlement: C
Indigenous Peoples: B
**** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects ****
Environmental Aspect
No adverse environmental impacts are anticipated as a result of project
implementation.
Involuntary Resettlement
The project will not cause any involuntary resettlement.
Indigenous Peoples
The project will pay special attention to ensuring that the delivery systems
will reach the indigenous and excluded groups.
**** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation ****
During Project Design
A fact finding mission was fielded intermittently from 21 October 2009 to 18
April 2010. The mission undertook a field visit to one of the Karnali districts
(Dolpa) from 23 October 2009 to 5 November 2009 to assess the ground realities
of implementing cash grants in the remote mountain districts of Nepal. A
workshop was organized in Kathmandu on 11 December 2009 to debrief central
government officials on the mission s field visit and to brainstorm on the
ideas that had been proposed by the DDC staff and local villagers in Dolpa.
Consultations were also held with development partners.
During Project Implementation
A midterm review of the project was undertaken during 1 - 5 April 2013 which
held consultation with the relevant stakeholders. A review mission - following
the extension of the physical completion date of the project from 8 June 2014
to 15 July 2015 - was undertaken during 7 - 19 July 2014. The mission held
consultations with the relevant stakeholders.
 
Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or
program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be
included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.
Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.
