Executive Summary
The proposed project, "Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards (BRCRH) is one the five Program
Components identified in Nepal's Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR).
Different components of the project are being supported and implemented by different agencies. The
World Bank is supporting BRCRH project. The proposed project aims to increase resilience to climaterelated hazards by improving the accuracy and timeliness of weather and flood forecasts and warnings
for vulnerable communities; as well as develop agricultural information management system services to
help farmers mitigate climate-related production risks.
The BRCRH project includes four components as follows.
Components A: Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building and Implementation Support of DHM.
This component has three subcomponents: i) Institutional Strengthening, ii) DHM capacity building and
training, and iii) Systems design and integration, project management and monitoring.
Component B: Modernization of the observation networks and forecasting
This component has five subcomponents: i) Technical modernization of the observing networks, ii)
Modernization of DHM’s communication and ICT systems, iii) Improvement of the numerical hydro
meteorological prediction system, iv) Design and pilot operation of an environmental monitoring
network, and v) Refurbishment / reconstruction of DHM offices and facilities.
Component C.: Enhancement of the Service Delivery System of DHM
The subcomponents of this components are: i) Introduction of a Public Weather Service (PWS) for (DRM,
agriculture, media, civil aviation, health, energy, water resources, irrigation), ii) Strengthening of DRM
operations including piloting of “end-to-end” early warning systems in two river basins in the western
and eastern parts of Nepal, iii) Improvement of service delivery (i.e. warnings and advisories) to
communities including introduction of mobile applications, and iv) Establishment of the National
Framework of Climate Service
Component D: DHM climate and weather information for users in agriculture – Agriculture Management
Information System
It has five subcomponents: i) Agriculture Management Information System – Portal, hardware and
software, ii) Information products, iii) Information dissemination, iv) Capacity building, v) Project
management, social and communication, monitoring and evaluation of component D.

The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) will implement Component A, Component B, and
Component C under the coordination of the Ministry of Environment, Science, and Technology (MOEST).
Ministry of Agriculture Development (MoAD) will implement Component D of the project.
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared for social and
environmental management of project activities during implementation, and is consistent with Nepal's
environmental and social policies and requirements as well as policies of the World Bank (WB).
Fragile geology, unstable steep slopes, high topographic variation, frequent change in river course, cloud
burst, climate change impacts have put Nepal at high risk to natural hazards. Floods, landslides,
droughts, wildfires take place recurrently causing immense damage to property and loss human life. The
country losses of properties equivalent to US $ 8 million, 4000 hectors of fertile land and displacement
of 20 thousands and death of around 300 people every year due to hydro meteorological disasters1.
Once River systems reach the Tarai Region, they often overflow their banks onto wide floodplains during
the monsoon, shifting course periodically. The rivers are deeply-incised across the east-west structural
grain of Nepal and the Himalaya, having eroded with the upliftment of the mountains.
Precipitation is generally concentrated in the regions below 500 m. Precipitation is relatively low in High
Mountain and High Himalaya (Sharma, 2003)2. It indicates that the occurrence of flooding in the Tarai
and Churia is comparatively higher than in high elevation zones. Furthermore, the districts in Tarai are
prone to floods (Very high risk-Mahottari; High risk- Rautahat, Chitwan, Parsa, Saptari, Siraha, Sunsari,
Dhanusha, Bara)3.
Nepal is divided into three ecological regions: High Mountains (35 % of total area), the Middle
Mountains (42% of total area), and the Churiya and Tarai (23 % of total area). The distribution of forest
land coverage is as follows: 23 % of total forest land in Mountain, 50 % in Hill and 37 % in Terai. On an
average, forest land has decreased at an annual rate of 1.7 %. Soil erosion and flooding are the major
causes of land degradation in the country. Nepal ranks at 25th position in terms of biodiversity with 11
bio-climatic zones, 118 ecosystems and 35 natural forests4. Sixteen protected areas (17% of the
country's total area) including national parks (9), conservation area (3), wildlife reserves (3), and a
hunting reserve (1) and six buffer zones have been established for the protection of flora and fauna.
The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture as approximately 66 percent of the national
population is engaged in agriculture. The country has 2.97 million ha gross cultivated land and 2.64
million ha net cultivated land. The cultivated lands have been distributed into: 52% in Terai, 40 % in Hill
and 8% in Mountain. With 65% of cultivated land in the slopes of hills and mountains where loss of
fertile topsoils due to erosion is common. Loss of topsoil due to erosion, pollutants, improper use of
pesticides and insecticides, and deforestation are leading factors of declining soil fertility in the country.

Lack of proper resources including means of recycling, infrastructures, equipment is a common problem
faced by the concerned agencies in managing solid waste. Haphazard solid waste collection and not
handled properly in recycling process and disposal system causes significant adverse impacts on public
health and the environment, contamination of surface water, ground water and soils as well. In the
absence of proper landfill sites, the collected waste is directly dumped in rivers or forest and agriculture
areas. There are no separate arrangements for managing hazardous waste. The scrap battery to be 2030 metric tons for the year 1998 and projected such battery scrap to 110-190 metric tons for 20085 in
the country.
About 1.8 million Population live in mountain, 11.5 million in hills and 13.4 million in Tarai. Multiethnic
and multilingual country with as many as 102 ethnic groups and 92 languages is in the country. The
country's current poverty level is 25.4 percent. 95.5 per cent of poor people live in rural areas and the
incidence of poverty in rural areas (28.5 percent) is almost four times higher than that in urban areas
(7.6 per cent). At national level, only 5 % of the population hold 27 % of lands of size 3 ha or more.
About 51 % of the population confined 59% of land of size 0.5-3 ha. Likewise, about 44 % of the people
hold 14 % of land of size less or equal to 0.5 ha.

The Gender Parity Index for secondary school net enrollment has also increased from 0.87 (2007) to
0.98 (2010). Quota-system brought in over 33 percent of women in the Constituent Assembly. The
maternal mortality rate declined from 538 in 1996 to 380 per 100,000 live births. Although the legal age
of marriage is 20 for both male and female, it is hardly implemented in Nepal.
Some key programs such as Social mobilization and empowerment, Income generation through microenterprise promotion, Community infrastructure, and Capacity building and human resources
development have been emphasized to reduce poverty in the country.
Environmental and social concerns (adverse impacts) of the project are not likely to be highly significant.
However, minor adverse environmental and social issues/ impacts are likely from the project e and are
related to few activities such as upgrading the meteorological stations (if it requires lands on an ideal
condition-equivalent to 0.06 ha), installation of Weather Radar System (WRS), utilization of dry-cell
battery for power supply system to operate hydrological and meteorological sensor in automated
operation mode.
Upgrading of existing hydrological and meteorological stations, installing WRS will include small scale
interventions such as surface improvements (removal of vegetation up to 5m x 5 m for Gauge House, 8
m x 8m for Cable House, 25 m x 25 m for automated weather station in an ideal condition 10 m x 7 m in
normal condition, and 60-100 m2 lands for Radar) and utilization of dry-cell battery of 12 V (170
batteries, 7 kg weight per battery). Use of huge machinery interventions or heavy machines is notrequired for any activities of the project.
The likely environmental adverse impacts due to these small scale interventions are s
trees/plants/vegetation loss when forest clear, solid waste and pollution which could causes health

hazards, agriculture/crops damage around the meteorological stations and access to them, and site
specific erosion risks.
Some of the devices such as batteries, barometers, thermometer etc may contain hazardous substances.
The e-wastes and used batteries, although the quantity is likely to be small, could be source of
hazardous substances containing toxic chemical and heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium,
nickel, acid that pose direct or indirect risks to environment, wildlife and human health.
Impact of modernization of hydrological stations on river water quality and quantity is non-existent or
negligible as no water will be withdrawn and the envisaged improvements/ modernization activities will
be very small in scale (activities such as few meter river bank protection around the station, installation
of simple flow measuring equipments, construction of steeling wells on the river banks and access to
flow measuring station). The environmental beneficial impacts of the project are likely to be expected in
several aspects such as improved mitigation and preparedness measures in disaster risk management,
promoted scientific understanding through reliable data and information, improved agriculture practices
and security.
The social adverse impacts of these small scale interventions are likely to be minimal and varied
according to the type of lands (government, and private), type of social groups (marginal farmer,
vulnerable groups), and educational status and gender imbalance. Furthermore, disturbances in lands,
less opportunity for unskilled workers, health hazards are likely to be happened in terms of social
adverse impacts of the project. The land required will be primarily taken on lease or donated voluntarily
against a token amount and part time employment. In very few cases land may be acquired which will
be very small in size. Although small in size, the lands are of great importance to vulnerable groups in
terms of living and livelihood. In this situation, based on the eligibility criteria and type of losses, the
affected families/individuals need appropriate compensation as well as resettlement and rehabilitation
assistances by adopting land acquisition process of GoN and resettlement policy framework of WB (see
below).

Major issues of vulnerable people including indigenous people are: likelihood of inclusions in the
project, involvement in capacity building process, exclusion from information and knowledge etc. The
project will adopt policy addressed towards inclusion, greater participation, capacity building through
the project.
Key gender issues are: likelihood of less participation of women, powerless and marginalized people in
different kinds of trainings and information dissemination program, low level of literacy to understand
the information; less chances of job opportunities for unskilled worker, women and the member of
marginalized communities etc. ESMF outlines the areas where women need special supports/assistance
and ensures women's participation to benefit from project subcomponents.
The social beneficial impacts of the project are likely to be expected in several social issues such as
improved employment opportunity (about 87,500 man days will be engaged for short term work),
Capacity building of communities, agencies in early warnings, additional supports for marginalized
people (relatively remote locations which are the preferred sites for upgrading the hydro meteorological
stations and these groups are likely to be more beneficiaries of the project), improved lifestyle (through
improved weather and climate information in agriculture production and food security), improved
technical knowhow of farmers.

The ESMF has been prepared by considering the relevant GON regulatory and policies and the WB
safeguard policy. The relevant framework/policies of GoN are: Environmental Protection Act and
Regulation 1997, Forest Act 1993 and Regulation 1995, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act
1973 and Rule 1996, Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization act 1987 and amendment
1992, National Agriculture Policy 2004, Local Self Governance Act 1999, Land acquisition Act (1977) and
Regulation amended in 1992, Gender and Child Rights mainstreaming Guidelines 2005. Likewise the WB
relevant safeguard policies are: Environmental Assessment, Forestry, Natural Habitats, Involuntary
Resettlement, Physical Cultural Resources, and Indigenous People.
The land acquisition process is generally lengthy (almost a year) if the project needs private lands.
Public lands (Government Lands) need to be given a high priority to implement subcomponent of the
project. Similarly, non availability of effective regulatory measures to manage for e-wastes is a major
challenge.
This framework includes: Environmental and social screening of the sub components; Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF), Framework for Vulnerable Community Development; Consultation
Dissemination Framework; Institutional Arrangement Framework; and Framework for Monitoring and
Mitigation and Adverse Impact.
Each subcomponent of the project will go through environmental and social screening in order to
identify relevant environmental and social concerns and suggest further investigation/ assessment if
necessary. Once the subcomponents are screened against all these criteria they will be categorized as
per the nature and magnitude of impacts: the ineligibility criteria include core protected area, world
heritage sites, and conflicted/disputed territory. Subproject/activity located in the protected area, but
out of core area, may be permitted on written permission from the competent authority. Preliminary or
full environmental assessment may be necessary for Category A and Category B subproject/activity, and
management/safeguard plans needs to be prepared. The sub components will consider alternative
designs (especially during site selection) in order to avoid land acquisition and minimize adverse social
impacts. A resettlement action plan with the cost of land acquisition will be prepared during the
implementation after screening subcomponents as per the guideline of WB. The compensation and
allowances cost will be estimated during the implementation of the subcomponents of the project.
Following key requirements need to be taken into account to implement subcomponents of the project.

Consultation especially for installation of WRS needs to be carried out in screening and
developing the project. PMU is responsible for the consultation.
Some activities such as installation and enhancement of stations in environmental sensitive
areas such as National Park, Conservation Areas, Ramsar area, protected forests and other
protected area is permissible only if written permission from the authorized officials is obtained
through due process and meeting all requirements. PMU will coordinate with the Department of
National Parks and Wildlife Conservations and/ or other relevant or competent party/ agency.
The activities should not be implemented in areas with high risk of landslides, floods and
erosion. PMU need to consult with the concerned agencies such as Department of Soil

Internal monitoring need to be carried out by PMU/DHM periodically and reported to the
Director of the Project. Project will carry out environmental compliance review once in sixmonth.
PMU need to consult the key stakeholders of the project such as disaster management agencies
including government, non-government, NRCS; managers, media, academician, farmers, and
service oriented agencies especially tourism, aviation etc
Collection of Battery, e-wastes and other hazardous wastes from the stations/sources to the
nearest collection center (Basin Offices/Regional Meteorological Offices/the DHM office at
Kathmandu) by utilizing outsources and by Department's staff during regular monitoring period.
The project will give preference to non-hazardous or the least hazardous alternatives available
in purchasing devices and use of systems (for example mercury free alternatives in battery,
thermometer, barometer etc, where possible or hybrid batteries that are less risky). Early in the
first year of project implementation, hazardous waste collection, recycling and management
system with due consideration to the risks of the hazardous wastes including from batteries will
be developed and put in place. One option is to use the auction process for recycling, which will
be carried out by PMU according to the government's rule and hazardous wastes management
and handling protocol/ procedure specifically developed for this project during the first year of
implementation. Out of 170 batteries, about 35 batteries may need to be collected two times
and the rest one time during the project period.
The compensation cost including allowances for affected land/property owners (crops/house
loss) will be estimated during the implementation of sub-component. PMU is responsible for the
estimation of the costs by consulting local market and Cost Determination Committee at district
level.
Mid-term Evaluation and Final Evaluation of social and environmental safeguard management
need to be carried out in second year and the last year during the project period. PMU is
responsible to facilitate administrative process for the selection of national evaluators.

At present DHM, the project implementing agency has little capacity to address social and
environmental safeguard management related to this project. In current practice social and
environmental safeguard management issues are not systematically addressed as there are no human
resources to address social and environmental safeguard issues at the department. DHM is not
equipped with capacity due to insufficient organizational set up and lack of trained manpower in the
field of environmental and social science. MOAD, another implementing agency of the project has
Gender Equity and Environment Division which helps Project Management Unit (PMU) in MOAD to
address social issues in the project.
Project Management Units (PMU) has been proposed at both implementing agencies (DHM and MOAD).
PMU will include technical, financial, procurement, environment and social specialists as may be
required..
The total estimated cost of ESMF implementation is about NPR 23.4 million (approx USD 0.26 million).

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The Government of Nepal (GoN) has prepared Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR), which
was approved by Climate Investment Fund (CIF). Nepal’s SPCR identified five areas/components for
investment. The investments outlined in the SPCR are expected to help Nepal to manage many climate
risks discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The areas of investment identified by SPCR are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Building Climate Resilience of Watersheds in Mountain Eco-Regions,
Building Resilience to Climate-Related Hazards,
Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in Development,
Building Climate Resilient Communities through Private Sector Participation, and
Enhancing Climate Resilience of Endangered Species.

The World Bank is identified for administering SPCR Component 2 i.e. Building Resilience to Climate
Related Hazards. Accordingly, preparation of the project on Building Resilience to Climate Related
Hazards (BRCRH) has begun with some preliminary and prerequisite activities, one of them being the
study presented here.
The project aims to develop a strong capacity to monitor and forecast hydro-meteorological events and
climate variability, and to deliver this information in timely and user-friendly manner to the key clients
(including farmers and disaster management professionals). Activities funded through the project would
help improve decision-making and planning in key climate vulnerable and water resources dependent
sectors, particularly agriculture, and contribute to building resilience for communities and sectors at
risk.
The need for a well-functioning early warning system has been identified as a key priority in the
Government of Nepal's National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management. At present, much of Nepal's
hydrological and meteorological system relies on manual data collection with infrequent and unreliable
reporting. Agro-meteorological information is another urgent priority to manage and mitigate climate
risk in Nepal's large and highly vulnerable agriculture sector, and to underpin the country’s food security
efforts. Seasonal climate predictions are currently not available in Nepal, which DHM aims to develop
within the framework of this project.
The study has been carried out in accordance with the scope of work for the study on "Preparation of
Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate
Related Hazards-Pilot Programme Climate Resilience (PPCR) under Environmental Impact Assessment
Programme" by Nature’s Conservation Pvt. Ltd., a leading National Consulting Firm working on hydrometeorological & environmental issues and development sectors in Nepal. The agreement between the
department and the Consulting Firm was held on 13th March 2012 (30 Falgun 2068 of the fiscal year
2068/069

1.2 Objective of the Work
The main objective of the consulting service is to prepare Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) for the Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards Project
(BRCRHP). Since the subprojects are known, this framework will provide guidance to prepare safeguards
documents during the implementation stage.

1.3 Scope of the Work
The scope of work includes the following:
Environmental assessment of the overall project
Review Legislative and Regulative, policies, Considerations
Review of Existing Environmental Management Practices
Institutional and Capacity Assessment
Development of Environmental Management Framework (EMF) including Institutional
arrangement for implementing EMF; Capacity strengthening plan; Consultation framework;
Carry out a rapid review of social issues involved and make broad-based social assessment of
the program/project (focusing on components and likely activities listed in the pre-feasibility
study), highlighting potential positive and negative impacts of the program/project.
Review policy and acts/ regulations of Nepal and the World Bank (OP 4.10, 4.12) in order to
identify applicable provisions in the proposed program/project and suggest ways to fill any gap
between Nepal and World Bank requirements.
Assess the capacity of the institutions involved in the project, including the roles and
responsibilities of implementing agencies, and offer guidelines for capacity development to
address any gaps.
Analyze and assess possible conflict, political economy factors and governance risks that could
potentially affect project implementation, and offer recommendations to mitigate these risks
and challenges. Key issues that will be dealt with will include: assessment of the political
environment; stakeholder mapping and analysis; conflict analysis; and other governance factors
that could influence the operating environment for the project;
Assess gender and social inclusion considerations related to project activities. This will include:
identification of key gender and inclusion related participation issues; identification of possible
roles for women and disadvantage (or vulnerable groups) in project objectives and activities;
examine the differences in knowledge, attitudes, practices, roles, status, wellbeing, constraints,
needs and priorities related to gender and other differences; assess the potential for

differentiated impact of project based on gender and exclusion and identify options to maximize
benefits and minimize adverse effects;
Develop a communication and consultation strategy for in line with the overall communication
and consultation strategy developed for the project to ensure that the project affected people
as well as the vulnerable groups, including women, benefit from the effective and timely
delivery of hydro-meteorological events and climate variability envisaged in the project;
Develop a Social Management Framework (SMF) for the Program/Project implementation
(fulfilling requirements for Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), Vulnerable Community
Development Framework (VCDF); and Gender Development Framework)

1.4 Methodology Adopted
The Environmental and Social Management Framework has been prepared by adopting several
processes: Consultation with Project Implementing Agencies; Scoping of the Project through Public

based
practitioners/persons, key leaders at community, farmers etc. The interactions were used to share
information about the project, understand their views about the project and its potential impacts. Ideas
were explored on how the project could provide assistance to targeted groups and to the local
development through the planned services. Discussions were also carried out with DHM part-time
observers/gauge readers to know their experiences including problems and issues regarding existing
hydro meteorological monitoring networks at field level.
1.4.2.3 Stakeholder Meetings/Workshop at District Level
The district consultations workshops were carried out in Lamjung and Ramechhap. Primary and
secondary stakeholders including representatives of local government bodies, non-governmental
organization, media, political parties, security agencies, etc. participated in the workshop. Likewise,
district level meeting chaired by Chief District Officers was conducted in Bardiya district. District level
government officers including NRCS district chapter participated in the meeting. The name of
participants is listed at Annex 1.1.
The steps adopted in the workshop are described in the annex (Annex 1.3).
1.4.2.4 Site observation and informal Interaction

The qualitative information gathered from the workshop through structured questionnaire was
analyzed. A spreadsheet program was used for frequency count of the responses. The perceptions of the
community about the project were quantified. The environmental, social, economic and agronomic
issues identified are presented in Chapter 4.

1.5 Limitation of the Work
The following are the limitations of this study.






The issues related to the project were collected in specific areas from the selected districts,
which could not be generalized for the nationwide issues.
Because of inadequate connectivity of DHM with locals, district level agencies and community's
unfamiliarity with the HMS related instruments (simple and advanced equipments), community
had difficulties in expressing their views about the project impacts.
Stakeholders in the districts were also not familiar with the simple and advanced technologies
like HMS networks and the equipment including the RADAR.
Political disturbance like unexpected shutdown disturbed the field visits affecting the collection
of data and information.

3. Relevant Policies and Regulatory Mechanisms
This chapter deals with regulatory, legislation and policy and practices of Government of Nepal (GON)
and World Bank. (WB) This chapter also focuses on the policy gaps between GON and WB.

3.1Background
In the context of the project 'Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards (BRCRH) -under PPCR'
implementation, Government of Nepal's policies, acts and regulations were reviewed. Similarly the
review process included the World Bank's Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies. Attempts have
been made to assess the relevance, adequacy and effectiveness of the current policies and regulatory
provisions. Attempts have also been made to identify measures to improve the effectiveness of these
provisions with regard to environmental and social aspects.
There are a several laws related to environment and social issues. The issues are directly and indirectly
concerned with disaster management, application of hydro-meteorological services, and agriculture
information management. In addition, some of the sectoral laws address some environmental and
social issues. The details of the reviewed policies and regulatory mechanisms are attached in Annex 3.1.

3.2. Relevant Policies
Of these policies highlighted in Annex 3.1, the policies relevant with the project are briefly explained
below.
3.2.1 Policies of Government of Nepal
Environment Protection Act and Regulations 1997 have made IEE and EIA mandatory for the
development projects. The list of development projects requiring IEE or EIA are given in the regulations.
The provided list indicates that the regulations are applicable for BRCRH project.
Forest Act 1993 and Regulation 1995 are applicable for the project if subcomponents require forest
lands. The regulation stipulates that the project is responsible to pay the compensation if it causes loss
or harm to any local individual or community. Similarly, the entire expenses required for the cutting and
transporting the vegetation products in a forest area used by the project shall be borne by the operators
of the project6.
The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 highlights the prohibited activities in a project
area. Activities are not allowed in protected areas (National Park, Conservation Area, Wildlife Reserve,
Hunting Reserve, Strict Nature Reserve and Buffer zones) without a written permission from the
authorized officials. In this regards, it is advisable to avoid such areas while developing a plan to
implement the subcomponents of the project. The rule (Conservation Area Management Rule 1996)
helps in screening the subcomponents of the project by assessing negative listings.
Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization act 1987 with amendment in 1992 describes the
procedures for disposing solid waste. The act categorizes harmful hazardous wastes and provides
6

http://www.forestrynepal.org/images/Forest_Act_of_Nepal_1993.pdf

13

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

information on several controlling measure. There is provision to appoint inspection officer for checking
and monitoring solid waste control and management. The inspector has authority to take action against
the polluter or polluting agency. Disposal of battery and electronic goods can be carried out on the basis
this act but it does not provide specific guideline for the disposal of such wastes. Auctions are the
procedure usually followed to dispose these wastes. The amendment of this act in 2011 is under the
process of endorsement.
National Agriculture policy 2004 gives special priority to the development of the pockets of high-value
agricultural products. The local bodies have the rights and responsibilities for the formulation,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of agricultural plans in their respective areas. On the basis
of this policy, farmers' groups receive on-site extension services. Resource centers are developed and
strengthened for producing local seeds, seedlings, plants and improved breeds. The proposed project
can play an important role in strengthening the centers by capacity building in the application of climate
information into agriculture practices.
Information and Communication Policy, 2059 (BS) has developed long-term policies on information and
communication sectors. The project can benefit from these policies as media can be mobilized in sharing
the subcomponents and its outcomes to the concerned stakeholders. Private and government related
mobile companies can be supportive as well as beneficiaries from this project through this policy.
Climate Change Policy GoN, 2001 addresses the issues of climate adaption and disaster risk reduction.
Fforecasting water-induced disasters and reducing created from climate change and providing early
warning information for disaster management are some of the key points of the policy. The policy
provides some guidelines to address the issues of vulnerable communities in the context of reducing
their risk to climate related disasters.
Land Acquisition Act, 1977, Land Acquisition Regulations, 1969 amended in 1992 empowers the
government to acquire land for development purposes by paying compensation to the landowner. The
land acquisition for subcomponents of this project can be acquired by means of these regulations.
Local Self Governance Act, 1999 provides more autonomy to District Development Committees (DDC),
Municipalities and Village Development Committees. According to the act, DDC has authority to
coordinate for screening and assessment of the subcomponents.
The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007: The Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007) includes provisions
that support gender equality and social inclusion. It has a separate article for women’s fundamental
rights (Article 20) and is inclusive toward Janajatis, Dalits, and Madhesis.

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

3.2.2Policies of the World Bank
World Bank's policy on Environmental Assessment (EA) states that all projects proposed for World
Bank's financing require an EA and Social Assessment (SA) to ensure that they are environmentally and
socially sound and contribute to sustainable poverty reduction. Various instruments are used to perform
EA depending on complexities of a project. They include Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA),
environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment and Environmental Action Plan (EAP). The World Bank's
environmental and social safeguard policies are the cornerstones of its support to sustainable poverty
reduction. The objective of these policies is to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their
environment in the development process. These policies provide guidelines for the bank and borrowers
staffs in identification, preparation and implementation of programs and projects.
The World Bank’s environmental assessment policy along with recommended processing is described in
Operational Policies (OPs). There are (10 + 1) WB safeguard policies comprising a) Environmental
Policies including OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.09 Pest
Management, OP 4.36 Forestry and OP 4.37 Safety of Dams b) Social Policies including: OP 4.11 Physical
Cultural Resources, OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and OP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples c) Legal Policies
including OP 7.60 Disputed Areas, and OP 7.50 International Waterways and d) Bank Disclosure Policy
(Bank Procedure 17.50).
Of these policies, the policies relevant to BRCRH project are briefly described below.
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) is conducted to ensure that Bank-financed projects are
environmentally sound and sustainable, and that decision-making is improved through appropriate
analysis of actions and of their likely environmental impacts. This policy is applicable for this project
because some key activities especially installation of Hydrological and Meteorological stations and WRS
may cause environmental adverse impacts.
This policy is applicable for screening the subcomponents of the project and for evaluating project's
potential environmental risks and impacts in its areas of influence. It also helps to examine project
alternatives; identify ways of improving project selection, planning, design, and implementation by
preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts enhancing
positive impacts; and includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts
throughout the period of project implementation.
Forestry (OP/BP 4.36) aims to reduce deforestation, enhance the environmental contribution of
forested areas, promote afforestation, reduce poverty and encourage economic development. It is
relevant to subcomponents which may be implemented in government or community forest areas.
According to this policy, the Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinion, would involve significant
conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical natural habitats. Some of the existing
hydrological and meteorological stations lie in forest areas. This safeguard policy will help to reduce
forest losses and deforestation when the stations to be upgraded in the forest region.

15

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) directs to support natural habitats while the subcomponents of the
project are implemented in national parks and protected lands. This policy affirms WB’s commitment to
promote and support natural habitat conservation with improved land use and the protection/
rehabilitation of natural habitats. In the context of BRCRH project natural habitats may comprise of
many types of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. They may include areas lightly modified by human
activities, but retaining their ecological functions and native species. WB does not support projects that
involve significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats. Some of the existing
hydrological in the protected regions forest areas. This safeguard policy will help to promote natural
habitat conservation when the stations to be upgraded in the forest region.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) policy is to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement where
feasible, exploring all viable alternative project designs; assist displaced persons in improving their living
standards, income earning capacity, and production level, or at least, in restoring them; encourage
community participation in planning and implementing resettlement; and provide assistance to affected
people regardless of the legality of land tenure. The policy provides guidelines for mitigating the adverse
effects of development projects including social and environmental impacts such as land acquisition,
relocation, loss of occupations and income sources, productive assets as well as community resources.
As highlighted in the project description, some key activities of this project may require private lands.
Thus this policy is applicable when private lands are used to implement the subcomponents of the
project.
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) policy is to assist in preserving Physical Cultural Resources
(PCR) and in avoiding their destruction or damage. PCR includes resources of archeological,
paleontological, historical, architectural, religious (including graveyards and burial sites), aesthetic value.
Cultural resources are important as sources of valuable historical and scientific information, as assets for
economic and social development, and as integral parts of a people's cultural identity and practices. The
loss of such resources is irreversible, but fortunately, it is often avoidable. This policy may govern while
implementing the VRCRH project at some locations which requires special attention while selecting
sites. Since the site for installing WRS has not been identified, this safeguard policy helps in guiding to
select the sites in cultural resources areas.
Indigenous People (OP/BP 4.10) Policy is to: (i) ensure that indigenous people affected by World Bank
funded projects have a voice in project design and implementation; (ii) ensure that adverse impacts on
Indigenous Peoples are avoided, minimized or mitigated; and (iii) ensure that benefits intended for
indigenous peoples are culturally appropriate. This policy underscores the need for Borrowers and Bank
staff to identify indigenous peoples, consult with them, ensure that they participate in, and benefit from
Bank-funded operations in a culturally appropriate way - and that adverse impacts on them are avoided,
or where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. This policy is applicable for several subcomponents which
need to be implemented in areas where there are significant presences of indigenous people/vulnerable
present. The discussions are summarized in the following table (Table 3.1).

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity7
Nepal is a signatory to this convention that came into force in Nepal as of 21 February, 1994. To
implement this commitment, Nepal is making efforts to develop national plan for biodiversity
conservation and management, to identify and monitor biodiversity and establish a network of
protected areas. Nepal is also attempting to include biodiversity as an essential component in
environmental impact assessments.
The convention calls for the adoption of national strategies, plans, and proogrammes for the
conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into their relevant sectoral plans.
Agenda 21
Nepal is implementing “Agenda 21”, a non-binding international statement of goals and principles. It
asks countries to promote activities that are well supported in Nepal, such as alleviation of poverty,
improved land use, conservation of biodiversity, public participation, empowerment of women, respect
of indigenous cultures, working with NGOs, development of human resources, etc
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands
On the basis of this convention, The Nepal Environmental Policy and Action Plan (NEPAP) 1993 have
given high priority to identification and protection of marshes, wetlands and water bodies which are
significantly rich in biodiversity. This plan has also recommended a study to assess the biological
diversity of endemic plants and animals, both terrestrial and aquatic that occurs outside protected areas
on farmlands, pastures, rangelands, forests, rivers, lakes and ponds. NEPAP is an effective initiative for
the protection of wetlands and has provided a good policy foundation for development of the National
Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP)
United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
UNFCCC provides the basis for global action" to protect the climate system for present and future
generations". This convention deals with reduction of greenhouse gases and other emissions.
Likewise the government as a member organization of WMO and ICAO has adopted the international
guidelines relevant to the Project.
ICAO Annex 3-Meteorological Services for International Air Navigation
ICAO guides the provisions for meteorological observation, meteorological forecasts, meteorological
warnings to pilots, aviation meteorological reports, and dissemination of meteorological Information. In
order to make effective services regarding meteorological information, Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal
(CAAN) coordinates with National Meteorological service (NMS)-DHM.

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

World Meteorological Organization Guidance, 2008
WMO provides guidelines for establishing a hydrometric or meteorological station. According to the
guidance, the recommended land area required for AWS is 25 m x 25 m. A series of automated sensors
are sited at the recommended positions and interconnected to one or more data collection units using
interfaces. About 12 V Battery is required to power an AWS. Approximately 170 batteries need to be
required. The life-time of each battery is about 1.5-2 years. Selecting an appropriate site for the weather
station is critical for obtaining accurate and representative meteorological data. Typically a site should
represent the general area of interest, and be away from obstructions such as buildings and trees.
Basel Convention, 1989
Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of Hazardous Waste and their disposal
was adopted in 1989. The convention came into force in 1992 and 170 parties have been in this
convention in 2008. The objectives of this convention are:







to minimize quantity and hazard of wastes generated
to endure environmentally sound management and adequate disposal facilities
to dispose of wastes as close as possible to their point of generation
to reduce trans-boundary movements
to prohibit exports from developed to developing countries
to provide support to Member States

3.4 Adequacy, Efficiency of Legal Provisions
The relevant policies of GON, WB and International Conventions discussed above are fairly adequate to
deal with the possible issues of environmental and social concerns related to BRCRH project and its
subcomponents.

4. Environmental and Social Issues
This chapter deals with an overview of environmental and social issues assessment related to project
components/subcomponents. The assessment includes environmental and social implication due to the
project components, current situation related to the project implementation including political risk,
conflicts, institutional capacity, public concerns, and gender and social inclusions.

4.1Environemtnal and Social Status of Nepal
Climate and Hydrology
Climate of Nepal is dominantly influenced by the South Asian monsoons. Average annual precipitation in
Nepal is 1760 mm, 80 % rainfall occurs in monsoon (June to September. The winter precipitation is due
to moisture coming from the Mediterranean Sea, and its intensity reduces to the east. Most parts of the
country have an average annual rainfall of 1,500mm to 2,500mm, the maximum being about 4,500mm
in Pokhara. A combination of sharp relief and fast-moving monsoon clouds bring frequent hailstorms
and cloudbursts; the latter trigger numerous landslides, landslide dams and debris flow. Landslide dam
outburst floods may sometimes cause extensive damage in downstream areas. Rainfall intensity
exceeding 100mm/24 hours are frequent in many parts of Nepal.
Annual mean temperature of Nepal is around 150 C. The winter season is the coldest, whereas the
highest temperature occurs during the pre-monsoon period. Summer and late spring temperature
maxima range from about 28° Celsius in the Hills to more than 40°C in the Terai. In winter, average
maximum and minimum temperatures in the Terai range from a brisk 7°C to a mild 23°C. Much colder
temperatures prevail at higher elevations. The Kathmandu Valley, at an average altitude of 1,310m, has
a mild climate with temperature ranging generally from 19° to 27°C in summer and from 2° to 20°C in
winter with occasional temperatures below freezing point in winter.
Around 6,000 rivers and rivulets including permanent and seasonal rivers, streams, and creeks, from
Nepal ultimately become major tributaries of the Ganges River in northern India. After plunging through
deep gorges, these rivers deposit heavy sediments and debris on the plains, nurturing and renewing
their alluvial soil fertility. Once they reach the Tarai Region, they often overflow their banks onto wide
floodplains during the monsoon, shifting course periodically. The rivers are deeply-incised across the
east-west structural grain of Nepal and the Himalaya, having eroded with the up-liftment of the
mountains.
Most of the major rivers in Nepal originate in the Himalayas with some having their origin in the Tibeaial
plateau. Glaciers are the sources of the big rivers of Nepal. In general, the river systems have a northsouth direction of flows. The Koshi River, the Gandaki River and the Karnali River are the most
prominent among the rivers in Nepal.

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

The priority risks due to climate risks and vulnerabilities in Nepal are: Quantity and quality of water,
Food Security, Ecosystem health and Human health8. Government of Nepal emphasizes some
adaptation progremms and policies in order to adapt climate change impacts: formulation of Renewable
Energy Perspective Plan, National Adaptation of Action (NAPA), Local Adaptation Programme of Action
(LAPA), Nepal Biodiversity Strategy, Climate change policy, Water and sanitation policy and strategy.
Forest, Biodiversity and National protected area
Nepal is divided into three ecological regions: High Mountains (35 % of total area), the Middle
Mountains (42% of total area), and the Churiya and Terai (23 % of total area). The climatic condition of
the country varies from alpine to subtropical conditions within a lateral span of less than 200 km. Within
the same span, altitudinal variation is observed from about 60 meter in the South and 8848 m in the
North.
A study shows the change (given below) in forest area per 100 ha in region between 1994 and 20009.

On an average, forest land has decreased at an annual rate of 1.7 %. The forest area in Nepal was last
reported at 25.36% in 2010 (World Bank, 2011).10 Soil erosion and flooding are the major causes of land
degradation in the country. Nepal ranks at 25th position in terms of biodiversity with 11 bio-climatic
zones, 118 ecosystems and 35 natural forests11. Sixteen protected areas including national parks (9),
conservation area (3), wildlife reserves (3), and a hunting reserve (1) and six buffer zones have been
established for the protection of flora and fauna (Figure 4.1). The protected areas make up about 17% of
the country's total area. Of these, the Sagarmatha National Park and the Royal Chitawan National Park
have been included in the World Heritage List; and the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Bishajari Tal
(Chitawan), Jagdishpur Jalasha Reservoir (Kapilbastu), and Ghodaghodi Tal (Kailali) have been designated
as Ramsar sites in the country.

Figure 4.1: Protected Areas in Nepal
(Adopted from Environment Assessment of Nepal: Emerging issues and Challenges)12
Agriculture area damage
About 76 % the population depends on agriculture. Agriculture land increased from 24 % in 1986 to 28
% in 2000 at national level in the country. By region, agriculture land decreased from 33 % in 1986 to 28
% in 2000 in the Hill region which could be due to natural calamities. Agriculture land increased from 5%
in 1986 to 10 % in 2000 in Mountain region and also increased from 42 % in 1986 to 56 % in 2000 in
Tarai region which could be due to population growth and very limited opportunity in non-farm
activities. The cultivated lands have been distributed into: 52% in Terai, 40 % in Hill and 8% in Mountain.
With 65% of cultivated land in the slopes of hills and mountains where loss of fertile topsoils due to
erosion is common. Loss of topsoil due to erosion, pollutants, improper use of pesticides and
insecticides, and deforestation are leading factors of declining soil fertility in the country.

Solid Waste and health impacts
Management of hazardous wastes is one of immense concerns in Nepal. Batteries, waste matter,
electronic wastes are some of sources of hazardous wastes. Users and the concerned agencies usually
collect the wastes. A proper disposal of collected wastes is generally very poor in the country. Lack of
proper resources including means of recycling, infrastructures, equipment is a common problem faced
by the concerned agencies in managing solid waste. Haphazard solid waste collection and not handled
properly in recycling process and disposal system causes significant adverse impacts on public health
12

http://books.icimod.org/uploads/tmp/icimod-environment_assessment_of_nepal.pdf

22

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

and the environment, contamination of surface water, ground water and soils as well. In the absence of
proper landfill sites, the collected waste is directly dumped in rivers or frest and agriculture areas. There
are no separate arrangements for managing hazardous waste.
Some efforts have been made to address hazardous waste management. For example, Solid Waste
Management and Resource Mobilization Act, 1987 (being amended) describes that solid waste cannot
be emitted, thrown, stored or disposed in any place other than place designated by the Solid Waste
Management and Resource Mobilization Center. Likewise, a study had estimated the scrap battery to be
20-30 metric tons for the year 1998 and projected such battery scrap to 110-190 metric tons for 200813.
In addition, Nepal has been a party of Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movement of
Hazardous wastes and their disposal.
Socio-economic Profile
The Preliminary Results of National Population Census 2011 of the county estimates a total population
of 26.7 million. Female population is estimated at 13.69 million while the male population stands at
12.92 million that is 48.56 percent males against 51.44 percent females. 1.8 million Population lives in
mountain, 11.5 million in hills and 13.4 million in Tarai. The population increased by 14.99 percent in the
past decade with an average annual growth rate of 1.40 percent. Multiethnic and multilingual country
with as many as 102 ethnic groups and 92 languages is in the country.
The country's current poverty level is 25.4 per cent, suggesting that it has been reduced by 5.5
percentage points since 2005.The 2008-2009 assessment of variation in poverty incidence
geographically and socially remains much the same as 2005 reporting period. The 2009 assessment
indicates that 95.5 per cent of poor people live in rural areas and the incidence of poverty in rural areas
(28.5 per cent) is almost four times higher than that in urban areas (7.6 per cent). Furthermore poverty
reduction rate in rural areas (18 per cent) is slower than that in urban areas (20 per cent). Remittances
are one of the main contributors to poverty reduction.
According to the Global Human Development Report 2009, Nepal has the lowest GDP per capita among
all South Asian countries (UNDP 2009). It also ranks below most of her neighbors in the Human
Development Index (HDI) ladder. The GDP per capita for Nepal in 2010 was about $ 130014. The slow
pace of economic growth in Nepal is also reflected in its GDP growth rates over recent years. Human
settlement is sparse in the Himalayan region due to harsh environmental conditions, the mountain
regions is the traditionally populated zones of the country. The Terai region, due to its comparative
advantage in transportation and agriculture resources, has led to the higher population growth than in
other regions. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture as approximately 66 percent of
the national population is engaged in agriculture. In terms of output, however, only 36 per cent of the
nation’s GDP is accounted for by this sector.

The land holding is a significant imbalance in land distribution according to the national survey in
2001/02. Only 5 % of the population hold 27 % of lands of size 3 ha or more. About 51 % of the
population confined 59% of land of size 0.5-3 ha. Likewise, about 44 % of the people hold 14 % of land of
size less or equal to 0.5 ha.

Gender Issues
Net Primary Enrollment in schools has increased from 81 percent in 2002 to 94.5 percent in 2010.
Gender and social parity have been achieved in primary education. The Gender Parity Index for
secondary school net enrollment has also increased from 0.87 (2007) to 0.98 (2010). Quota-system
brought in over 33 percent of women in the Constituent Assembly. However, women's low status in the
control of resources and political decision making remains, as does high incidence of violence against
women (including early marriage and sex selective abortions).
The maternal mortality rate declined from 538 in 1996 to 380 per 100,000 live births, earning Nepal the
MDG Millennium Award in 2010. The Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 79 in 1996 to 39 in 2010. At
least one-third of deliveries are now in the presence of trained health workers. Full immunization
coverage rose from 43 percent in 1996 to 87 percent in 2011.
The mortality rate among children under five years has been halved during the past 10 years which
could be due to well-coordinated scale up of highly effective child survival interventions, such as vitamin
A distribution, immunization and pneumonia treatment. The largest challenge today is addressing
mortality among newborns, now accounting for 54 percent of all deaths among under-five children.
Gender disparities in political participation are decreasing both in elected and administrative
government. Women now make up over 30 percent of the representatives in parliament.
Implementation of an inclusion policy of women in the civil service shows positive trends.
Although the legal age of marriage is 20 for both male and female, it is hardly implemented in Nepal.
According to Muluki Ain marriage chapter, the legal age for marriage is 20 for both male and female
2010 or 18 where the marriage is solemnized with the consent of guardians.
About 55 per cent women aged 25-49 were married by the age of 18 in 2011, according to Nepal
Demographic Health Survey (NDHS). Likewise, 18 per cent of women aged 25-49 years in Nepal are
married by the age of 15. Women in Nepal get married at a fairly young age — the median age of
marriage for women aged 25-49 in 2011 was 17.5 years. Only 19 per cent of men in the same age group
are married by 18 years of age and the median age at first marriage for men aged 25-49 is 21.6, four
years later than women, NDHS reported. As per the survey, only two per cent of Nepali women aged 2549 years had given birth by the age of 15, while 23 per cent gave their first birth by the age of 18.
Poverty Alleviation Programms
The 10th Plan followed by the second three year Interim Plan (2010-12), the government has given
priority to poverty alleviation. In this regards, some key programs such as Social mobilization and
24

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

empowerment, Income generation through micro-enterprise promotion, Community infrastructure, and
Capacity building and human resources development have been emphasized to reduce poverty through
Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) in Nepal15. PAF seeks to contribute directly to achieve the national
objectives: to attain the level of poverty to 10 percent in 20 years in pursuant with the long term goal of
Nepal Government; and to reduce poverty by half by the year 2015 as per the millennium development
goals.

4.2 Environmental and Social Impacts of the Project
The project would support a wide range of activities. Most of the activities which are based on the
production of HMS services are unlikely to have environmental and social implications. However, there
are possibilities of a few likelihood adverse environmental and social impacts due to particular activities
like: installation of instruments for automatic weather system, Weather Radar System (WRS), by
products of equipments system, and Capacity building trainings, etc. Potential subcomponents which
could have some adverse environmental and social impacts are summarized below. Subcomponent-wise
likelihood implications are listed in Annex 4.1.
Adverse Impacts
There are few subcomponents of the project causing likelihood adverse impacts on society and
environment.
Subcomponent 1: Technical Modernization of the Observing networks and Modernization of DHM
communication and ICT system
Environmental Impacts:
 Vegetation removal: impacts due to forest clearance/ trees/plants removal if a station is located
in a forest area . Land needs to be cleared up to 5m x 5m for Gauge House, 8m x 8 m for Cable
House and 25m X 25m lands for Automated Weather Station in ideal condition. According to
this, approximately the total lands to be required as: 0.45 ha lands (for hydrological stations),
and 6 ha lands (for meteorological stations) in ideal condition. The existing stations are not
defined clearly in terms of locations, lands. The precise scale of impact in each case will be
assessed during the implementation of the subcomponents, and an appropriate mitigations,
where necessary, will be implemented.
 Hazardous and e-wastes: Dry-cell battery is the most commonly used power supply system to
operate hydrological and meteorological sensor in automated operation mode. Such batteries
are likely to affect human health and environment if they are not disposed properly16. The
devices such as batteries, thermometer, barometer, electronics etc are sources of hazardous
and e-wastes. They may be containing mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, acid, zinc, lithium, etc.
Leaching of these chemicals into soil or water or into air affect the environment, wildlife and
human health, or the staff/workers may come in direct contact with them.

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

 Damage to agriculture: Limited damage to agriculture fields with regular mobility of office staff
observers and gauge readers in and around the stations. The impacts may also extend to limited
pollution of water sources (this impact may possible if office staff regularly moved to sites)
 Denudation at the hill top: Since radar will be installed with construction work on the hill top
which are usually covered by forest, the loss of trees and plants may extend to about 60-100
square meters.
Social adverse Impacts:
 Disturbances in agriculture lands: Although limited in extent impacts are expected on private
and public lands, structures, standing crops and community infrastructures when AHS and AMS
installed.
 Employment loss: Likely to lose the job opportunities by a gauge reader observer if the location
of a hydrological or a meteorological station is changed to a better location during the
upgrading of a station. The changed location may not be suitable for continuation by the
employed person.
 Limited job opportunities to the weaker class: Less chances of job opportunities for unskilled
worker, women and the member of marginalized communities as they have usually weaker
awareness and poorer access to the development activities.
 Gender imbalance: Women are likely to be discouraged by their families particularly in
hydrometric work as the sites may be located in difficult conditions and that the work may
become more challenging during high flood conditions.
 Electrical and electronic pollution: Adverse impacts due to waste electrical, electronic (e-waste),
and metallic equipment. Improper disposal of such wastes is the usual practice in Nepal, which
may cause health hazards and pollution problems.
 Radiation hazards: Although no significant adverse impacts on health have been reported during
operation of WR17, WHO highlights that the Radio Frequencies between 300 MHz and 15 GHz
may interact differently with human body18.
 Education and awareness: During our field visits, people have expressed concerns about the
possible long-term adverse effects of WRS on health including cancer, reproductive malfunction,
and changes in behavior or development of children.
Subcomponent 2: Enhancement of Hydro meteorological Forecasting System
Environmental Impacts:
Most of the environmental impacts described in the subcomponent 1 are valid for this component as
well.

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

Additional factor is the extra consideration of environmental pollution that results from the added
electrical, electronic goods, solar panels (life time 20-25 years) and battery recharging systems (life time
1.5 years).
Social Impacts:
Likelihood of adverse impacts due to waste electrical, electronic and metallic equipments, unavailability
of facilities for processing such wastes may cause health hazards and pollution problems.
Subcomponent 3: Introduction of Public Weather Service (DRM, agriculture, media, civil aviation,
health, energy, water resources etc)
Environmental Impacts:
Dissemination of information will have no noticeable environmental consequences. It means, no any
environmental adverse impacts of dissemination.
Social Impacts:
 False alarms: Dissemination of wrong information and false alarms by mistake or by poor
estimations may cause unnecessary havoc among public and concerned agencies.
 Misinterpretation: inadequate training and limited level of awareness may lead to the
misinterpretation of the available information and warnings that may lead to wrong actions with
more damages.
Subcomponent 4: Developing an Agriculture Insurance Scheme Program and Raising climate resilient
agriculture science, practices and applications of agriculture management information system
Social Impacts:
 Crop failure: failure of crop if the agrj-advisory is not implemented with right plans and
procedures or the advisory is not properly disseminated or misunderstood because of poor
trainings. Marginalized people could be more affected in such situation as the level of
awareness is less compared to more advantaged groups.
 System failure: In case of high dependence of the farmers on the advisory system, they may face
setbacks in case of the failure of the system in delivering proper advisories in time or in case of
the failure of telecommunication systems and networks.
 Disagreement in mobile distribution: Distribution of mobile sets is limited that may cause
disagreement among farmers.
Beneficial Impacts
Subcomponent 1: Technical Modernization of the Observing networks and Modernization of DHM
communication and ICT system

27

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

Social Impacts
 Employment opportunities: Increased opportunities will be available for the locals to obtain
additional employment as about five to ten labors will be engaged during construction phase of
AWS and AHS for three days to a fortnight. According to the subcomponent of the project,
about 175 stations (100 AMS and 75 AHS) will be installed during the project. It indicates that
almost about 87,500 labor (man days) will be engaged for short term work.
 Training opportunities: Locals may obtain training opportunities in the field of the operation of
stations, equipment, automation, station maintenance, telecommunication systems, hydrology
and meteorology,
 Capacity building: Build the coping capacity of concerned individuals, communities and agencies
by receiving reliable hydro-meteorological information and early warnings about the likely
floods and other water-induced disasters. Such information provide them opportunities to get
prepared for mitigation measures.
 Improved adaptive measures: With the flows of appropriate information and trainings, people
will be prepared for better measures for climate change and disasters. Improved productivity:
Farmers would be benefited with better and more reliable information, which may lead to
better productivity.
 Improved assessments: reliable and timely availability of data and information can improved the
understanding of science and impacts for the individuals and agencies concerned about the
processes.
 Additional support for marginalized people. Since the migration of women and marginalized
groups are limited in relatively remote locations which are the preferred sites for hydrometeorological installations, these groups are likely to be more beneficiaries of the project
activities.
Beneficial Environmental Impacts:
 Improved mitigation measures: Enhanced opportunities as a result of improved data quality and
better dissemination system ar3e likely to assist in developing effective strategies for mitigating
environmental degradations and for developing appropriate adaptation measures.
 Promote scientific understandings: Availability of reliable data and information and improved
access to such data will provide platform for scientific communities for research and
developments leading to better scientific understanding of the environmental processes. Such
developments are the keys to the success of environmental management.
Subcomponent 2: Enhancement of Hydro meteorological Forecasting System and Installation of
Modern computer processing and display system
 Improved skills: Technical staff will have better skills for monitoring environment in more
reliable manner. Increased awareness: increased level of awareness among different
stakeholders will help to interact with the environment in a environment friendly approach.
 Utilization of local resources: Application of available human and natural resources will be
beneficial for upgrading the capacity of environmental management at local level.

28

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

 Favorable working environment: Technical staff will have more favorable working environment
with better equipment and enhanced communication with the headquarters and regional or
basin office.
 Informed decision: Beneficial for the general public to know the information about the weather
conditions and possible threats of the weather while managing their daily life with compatible
and environmentally friendly approaches.
Subcomponents: Developing an Agriculture Insurance Scheme Program and Raising climate resilient
agriculture science, practices and applications of agriculture management information system
 Improved lifestyle: Improved weather and climatic information may enhance the agriculture
productivity and food security bringing changes in the lifestyle of the farmers leading to better
awareness and education, which will ultimately help for environment friendly sustainable
development
 External support: Introduction of insurance schemes will bring insurance related agencies into
the picture working with farmers jointly for better management skills for reducing risks, which
will contribute to the management of environment as well.
Technical knowhow: About 1300 farmers will get and mobile sets that assist them to develop
their capacity to use agriculture information system by using mobile system
Potential Impact on River Water
The project will support technical modernization of existing hydrological stations for river flow
measurement in Nepal’s river across the country. The type of activities includes improving the flow
conditions around the flow measurement stations, river bank stabilization for protecting the
hydrological station, and installing flow measuring equipments. Construction of new hydrological
stations is not envisaged. The activities envisaged also include stable access to natural river flow at
the point of water flow measurement, stabilization or reinforcement of few meters a river bank at
some hydrological sites, construction of steeling wells on the river banks and other small scale
improvements. These activities will be very limited in scale. During construction of the mentioned
civil works river water turbidity around the sites may slightly increase. However, this effect is minor
and localized which is unlikely to be noticeable beyond immediate constriction sites. There will be
no water withdrawal. Hence, the project activities will not lead to any noticeable river flow
disturbance or water quality deterioration beyond immediate site of hydrological station.

4.3 Institutional Capacity Assessment
The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) under the Ministry of Environment, Science and
Technology (MoEST) is the principle institution responsible for providing hydrological and
meteorological services in the country. At present, the department has four divisions such as
29

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

Hydrological Division, Meteorological Division, Weather Forecasting Division, and Meteorological
Network Division. Each of these divisions is supervised by a Joint Secretary-level staff. The department
has a total strength of 233 staff. At regional level, the department has three basins offices in three major
river basins (Koshi, Narayani, and Karnali) responsible for monitoring hydrological system. Likewise, for
monitoring meteorological system, the department has three Meteorological Regional Offices: Eastern
Climate Regional Office, Western Climate Regional Office, and Mid & Far Western Climate Regional
Office.
Human Resource capacity to seek out environmental and social concerns
Snow, Glacier, Water Quality & Environment Section under Hydrological Division is responsible for
monitoring snow, glacier, water quality, and environmental issues. A total of nine staff including six of
officer classes are working for the section. Although the section has some capacity to monitor snow and
water quality aspects, it has insufficient strength to address environmental issues related to this project.
Although the department provides regular trainings on hydrological and meteorological monitoring
system but it hardly provides trainings on environmental management. Likewise, the department has no
human resources to address social issues. Key limitations in the department to address overall
environmental and social issues are: limited resources (technical and finance), and lack of experts to
address social issues. Technical experts from social and environmental specialist will be appointed in
PMU as needed, for full time in the initial phase of implementation which may be made intermittent at
later stage. PMU is responsible to address ESMF issues.
Environmental and social issues can be addressed in the department by employing environmental and
social scientists. Staff training on environmental issues must be included at different levels on regular
basis.
Currently, DHM has inadequate official networks at district level. As a result, coordination with the
concerned stakeholders at community levels is insufficient to address social and environmental issues
locally. Coordination and communication framework (see chapter five) will help to link with the
stakeholders at local level. Once the department has adequate resources with a concrete plan, it can
work with local governments to reduce environmental risks.
Institutional relationship of MoAD is well established at central, district, and community and farmers
levels. However, there is significant gap in resources including technical skill, communication means, etc
particularly at local levels. Efforts are necessary to build capacity of Agriculture and Livestock Service
Centers in managing environmental issues.
Governance and Grievance
As stated in the project description, potential adverse impacts of the project are not significant in
general. There is less chance of dissatisfactions among the impacted population regarding the
implementation of the project. During the field visits, people, in particular raised the issues related to
possible opportunities and the added benefits at local level. Such concerns are likely to appear as

30

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

grievances during the project implementation phase. Satisfactory strategy should be developed
beforehand to address such concerns while developing project implementation plan. The project should,
hence, develop a mechanism that ensures to address such issues. Grievance redress mechanisms are
institutions, instruments, methods and processes by which a resolution to a grievance is sought and
provided19. The project will have a complaint system that allows stakeholders/affected people to raise
issues or complaints through District Administration Office (DAO)/Chief District Officer (CDO) at district
level. PMU will coordinate with CDO by to address the complaints. Where isolated vulnerable people
are concerned, PMU/DHM will ensure to address their issues in culturally appropriate ways in close
coordination with the relaxant group.
External Relations and Partnership
DHM has been developing public relations especially with the key stakeholders including government
and non-government agencies. The media and public relations with the department depend on its
services available to the partners. In addition to the partnership of the department, it has a very good
understanding of the needs of partners. In this regards, the department needs to work on the partner's
needs base. The department should have a coordination section and partnership policies to address
social and environmental issues during the project implementation and post-project period.
Sustainability
Sustainability of the project depends on institutional and financial issues. Financial constraints are the
limitations on improving institutional and project implementation/monitoring capacities. Likewise,
political instability and uncertainties of the institutional policies are likely to have adverse impacts on
the project. The project implementing agencies should have ability to develop a diversified funding base
capable of sustaining its programmes over the long-term period. In addition to financial issues, the
department should have a service delivery strategy to address sectoral areas: hydropower, DRR,
tourism, agriculture, irrigation, drinking water, energy etc. The department can develop fundraising or
cost recovery strategies providing its services to different sectors except in humanitarian response.
Political Risk
Since the government is in power transformation stage through federal system, many stakeholders
except significant benefits (political and economic benefits) from the project. In this situation, both
ministries (MOAD and MOEST) need to have institutional guideline to address stakeholders concerns
and social issues in changing political environment.

4.4 Public and stakeholders Feedback
As discussed in the methodology section, the stakeholders' consultations were carried out at central and
district levels. The district level consultations were carried out in Lamjung, Bardiay and Ramechhap
whereas central level consultation was held in Kathmandu. The objectives of the consultation were to:
disclose the project objectives and discuss its possible social and environmental implication. In addition,
the interactions were useful to discuss the project components with the beneficiary communities and
seek their views and perceptions. Discussion about the project with the vulnerable groups present in the
19

http://www.adb.org/Document/SPF/Consolidated-Final-Report-05182009

31

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

communities. The discussion was also fruitful to review current procedures and mechanisms for
voluntary land donation for station establishment.
Primary stakeholders in the interaction programme included beneficiaries, farmers, disaster managers,
DHM's hydromet data observers/recorders, women, DHM's Basin and Regional offices, staffs, key
informants of District Disaster Relief Committee (DDRC) and Agriculture and Livestock Service Centers,
etc. Likewise, secondary stakeholders included NGOs, CBOs, Media, Political Parties, community
representatives, and other GoN's district and regional offices. The details about the outputs of public
consultation are given in the proceeding report (Appendix of this report).
The issues raised in the consultations are summarized below.
Land Acquisition
Currently, the observatory stations are sitting both in public (Government) and private lands. Land
encroachment towards observatory station is a key issue when the land is not properly secured. The
fencing around observatory station is not sufficient to ensure its security. Private lands for the
observation stations are obtained from land owners on voluntary basis. Since insignificantly small area
(mentioned in section 4.2) for the enhancement and upgrading of existing station, availability of
voluntarily available private lands is likely to be a sensitive issue.
Suggestion made available by the stakeholders included:
a) The observatory station should be in government's owned lands by ensuring security of the station
from human and natural risks; and b) Government should purchase private land to install/enhance
hydrological and meteorological stations.

Vegetation, Biodiversity and Natural Habitats
Observatory lands are required is small in sizes (less than 0.1 ha in idle condition). Notwithstanding
likelihood of vegetation clearance to install AHS and AMS can be significant as the project activities
involve several stations. Stakeholders advocating conservation issues highlighted that the installation of
stations should avoid forest as much as possible. Special efforts are necessary for assessing the sites,
locations, types of vegetations, sensitivity of natural habitats, flora and fauna.
Human Health and Waste Management
The stakeholders discussed on the possible health impacts due to the subcomponents of the project
during implementation and operation. Although there were not many issues regarding the adverse
impacts of automatic weather and hydrological systems, people were particularly concerned on the
possible adverse impact of Radar System and its radiation field on health including cancer, reproductive
malfunction, and changes in behavior or development of children.

32

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

It is important to distinguish between perceived and real danger that radar pose, as well as to
understand the rationale behind existing international standards and protective measures. Safety
analysis needs to be carried out during feasibility study of radar.
Electronic wastes, battery used for power supply and other devices in operating automatic stations may
cause problems in a long run if they are not scientifically managed. In this regards, management plan at
project level with a proper mitigation measures need to be developed during the project
implementation. Special attentions needs to be given in managing and dealing with the hazardous and
e-wastes that might be generated from the batteries, thermometer, barometers, and other devices and
may contain mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, acid etc. Project will give preference to devices that are
non-hazardous or the least hazardous (such as mercury or lead free etc) if available. The project, early in
the first year of implementation, will prepare and issue a hazardous waste and e-waste management
protocol/guidelines/ procedure for use in the project. A general checklist and the formats for EMP are
given in Annex 2.1 and Annex 5.1 as a reference.
Income Generation
Local people were particularly interested to know about the possibility of income generation from the
project. Local human resources needed to be involved in the project during implementation of
subcomponents and also during operation period to the possible extent.
Likewise, the existing resource persons, such as observers and gauge readers, raised an issues about the
security of their employment in the scenario of automation. The stakeholders suggested that both the
manual and automatic systems should be operated for the consistency of data and information.
Gender Inclusion and Participation of Vulnerable Groups
Stakeholders raised the issues of the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in the project.
Participation of vulnerable community need was one of the major highlighted issues during district
consultations. Stakeholders highlighted the needs of changing the prevailing situation of minimum
employment opportunities provided to women and vulnerable groups with higher domination of elite
classes.
4. 5 Gender and social inclusion considerations related to project
Based on the public discussion, field visit and social implication of the project, the issues about the social
inclusions are listed as:






likely low level of involvement of women and socially vulnerable groups in project activities
Low level of participation in decision-making
Less access to benefits of project activities
Less involvement of women in hydrological project activities due to challenging nature of work
for women
Discrimination in project related employment opportunities as stereotypical roles confine
women to the household activities

5. Environmental and Social Management Frameworks (ESMF)
5.1 Salient Features
It is essential that the potential environment and social concerns of the proposed project activities are
thoroughly assessed in planning phase and design phases during which appropriate measures can be
considered for the project implementation.
ESMF has been developed as a decision making tool to ensure that the project activities selected and
implemented under project are socially responsive and environmentally sound. This framework will
serve as a tool to guide the project implementers to select the optimal project intervention required to
address social and environmental concerns, prepare mitigation plan, and to ensure complete integration
of social and environmental concerns and mitigation measure in the design of the project activities.
ESMF recognizes the need for an early environmental and social assessment, during preplanning stage
of activities at the field level to identify any adverse impact which helps to plan mitigation measures and
help in mainstreaming this aspect throughout the implementation phase. ESMF has been prepared fully
by considering the WB safeguard policy and GON regulatory/policy requirements. This framework
includes environmental and social screening of the subcomponents; Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF); framework for vulnerable community development; consultation dissemination framework,;
institutional arrangement and capacity building framework; and framework for monitoring and
mitigation of adverse impacts.

5.2 Environmental management system
The Environmental Management System (EMS) establishes the criteria to identify the level of processes
involved in environmental assessment, their sequence to conduct the studies for various
components/phases of BRCRH project including their legal requirements and implications. Once the
need/justification of a subproject/activity is finalized, the process of EMS starts with environmental and
social screening processes.
5.2.1 Environmental and social concerns
The environmental and social impacts identified (given in Chapter four) at this stage are preliminary and
generic in nature. It must be further elaborated with higher level of specificity ascertaining the scale of
impacts during the implementation stages of subcomponents and activities. The potential impacts are
identified during various stages of the activities depending on location, design, construction and
operation as their potential nature, extent, duration and severity differs because of the difference in
locations, nature of subcomponents and stages. Having categorized the stage-wise potential impacts
specific to a subcomponent/subproject/activity, they are further elaborated in the appropriate stage of
the project.
5.2.2 Environmental and Social Screening
It will be ensured that the project design and implementation of the proposed subcomponents or
activities are socially responsive and environmentally sound. While currently, project components and
their sub components and individual activities are identified, precise identification of their
35

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

locations/areas will be finalized during project implementation. Most of the adverse social and
environmental impacts of the BRCRH project are site specific. Environmental and social impacts of each
subcomponent/subproject of the project will vary in their extent, magnitude and duration as per the
nature and scale of the subcomponents and location chosen.
5.2.2.1 Screening criteria
In general, the environmental and social screening process identifies what levels of environmental and
social assessment are required for the subcomponents. The purpose of the screening is to get relevant
concerns addressed at an early stage. It ensures proper designs with adequate considerations mitigate
environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, it enhances opportunities for proper budgeting.
The participation and consultation with beneficiaries/local communities and stakeholders are important
in identifying the potential impacts of the interventions. The criteria (Table 5.1) are developed on the
basis of the threshold values highlighted in safeguard policies of WB and environmental policies of
GoN's; which are: (i) degree of impacts on the livelihood systems ( ii) loss of common property resources
affecting their livelihood systems (iii) subcomponents affecting landlessness, shelter, unemployment,
marginalization and food security (iv) activities that require relocation of households, acquisition of
lands and other properties (v) subcomponents that promote or involve child labor and (vi)
subcomponent that is likely to make adverse impact on indigenous people, women and vulnerable
groups including Dalits (occupational groups), (iv) potential risks to natural habitats and forests, (v)
pollution risks including land, water and air, (vi) human health and occupational safety, (vi) land slope
stability, and (vii) built artifact or heritage .
Each subcomponent of the project will go through environmental and social screening in order to
identify relevant environmental and social concerns. The screenings are also helpful to suggest if any
further investigation and assessment is necessary. Once the subcomponents are screened against all
these criteria they will be categorized as indicated in the Table 5.1 and as per the nature and magnitude
of impacts. An environmental checklist for screening is given in Annex 5.5. Category A is high risk
activity, which are either not-allowed or discouraged as explained in Table 5.1. Subproject or activities in
the following locations are ineligible for support under the project.
Located in core protected area (national park, conservation area, wildlife reserve, Ramsar
site, etc ), World heritage sites, and conflicted/ disputed territory.

heritage sites are high risk. Similarly from social consideration, project sites
included project activities resulting in loss of common property resources affecting
livelihood system of local people; and major land acquisition and relocation of local
people. An EIA is carried out for this type of activities as per GON EPA/ EPR 1997.

Category B

environmental impact is possible. This will require carrying out an Initial
Environmental Examination (IEE) as per GON EPA/ EPR 1997.
Subcomponents intervention which is likely to have no or minimal adverse
environmental and social impacts. This will not require Environmental Assessment
beyond environmental screening. Vulnerable section of the projects area, such as
schedule castes, women, landless and other poor individuals and families should
receive special consideration during project implementation. Environmental and
social monitoring mechanisms have to be developed for this purpose.

Hydro meteorological stations in National Conservation Areas by taking a written permission from the
authorized officials as per the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 and Conservation Area
Management Rule 1996.
5.2.2.2 Screening Process
At the time of implementation, the subcomponents need to be screened before carrying an impact
assessment. PMU of the project will take responsibility for screening the subcomponents and preparing
37

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

the screening report. Project Screening Committee (PSC) will approve the screening report but MOEST is
responsible to approve the report if EIA and IEE required for any activities.
The screening process intends to:




Determine potential impacts of selected subcomponents as to whether they are likely to cause
negative environmental and social impacts, identify the types and classify in terms of Categories;
Determine appropriate mitigation measures for activities causing adverse impacts;
Incorporate mitigation measures into project designs before implementation;

5.2.3 Environmental Assessment and Monitoring
There is no need for further assessment when activities/subcomponents fall in Category C, but it
requires a simple environmental management plan including mitigation measures and monitoring
system.
Category A and category B subproject/ activity will have to be assessed for their potential adverse
impacts and mitigation measures developed and an EIA or an IEE will have to be carried out. This will
require field work. PMU will commission an EIA or IEE (a brief process for the assessment is given in
Annex 5.1).
Consultation and Dissemination. When the sites of subcomponent's activities with their possible
environmental and social issues are exactly defined, stakeholder consultation will be carried out at
policy and implementing level following transparency principles

Follow-up-Environmental Monitoring
Follow-up will be done to confirm the effectiveness and relevance of the implementation of the
proposed mitigation measures. Monitoring will be carried out in accordance with the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) in specific activities such as installation of WRS. The EMP will be prepared for
each subcomponent by PMU including the monitoring indicators for the subcomponents.
Project will also carry out six-monthly environmental compliance review through project’s
environmental specialist or independent consultant.

5.3 Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
5.3.1 Land acquisition Concern
The project's activities are primarily based on upgrading existing stations. According to DHM, about 60
meteorological stations are in public (government) land and 40 stations in private lands. Likewise,
hydrological gauging stations are in government land. The required lands are in the range of 25 m X 25
m in idle case and 10m X 8m in other case for upgrading the stations. Weather Radar System (WRS) may
need about 100 m2 for installation. The lands for WRS will be purchased if it is feasible in private land.

40

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

The statements below is removed from wb but need to discuss
The cost for the installation will be estimated during feasibility study.
For the land acquisition, land acquisition policy and guideline need to be adopted if the department
requires private land to install such types of instruments. The department will assess the details about
identification of the location, types of lands (public/government and private) priority and determination
of the size of lands to be acquired. In most cases land will be taken on lease as is in the existing cases.
As per the World Bank policy, a resettlement policy framework has been developed in an attempt to
minimize and / or mitigate potential adverse social impacts. The framework has defined groups of
potentially affected people with varied eligibility groups such as Project Affected People (PAP), Project
Affected Families (PAFs), Significantly Project Affected Families (SPAFs), Marginal Farmers (FMs),
Displaced Families (DFs), squatters, encroachers, and other vulnerable groups. Based on the eligibility
criteria and type of losses, the affected families or people will be provided compensation as well as
resettlement and rehabilitation assistances. An entitlement policy matrix to this effect has been
developed as safeguard measures to mitigate the losses by types of categories of affected people viz
owners, tenants, encroachers, squatters' communities etc.
5.3.2 Policy Guiding Principles:
According to the Bank policy on involuntary land acquisition, the guiding principles recognizes lost assets
or income as fundamental right of all project affected persons and that physically displaced people must
be relocated with basic amenities like school, health posts etc. Likewise all affected persons or
entrepreneur or institution should be assisted to restore at least their pre -project income and livelihood
status. Absence of legal title to land should not be a bar for compensation, resettlement, and
rehabilitation assistance. Vulnerable groups such as indigenous people, Dalits, women-headed
households, and senior citizens should be entitled to special benefit packages in addition to
compensation and resettlement. It is recommended to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement
wherever feasible, exploring all potential alternative arrangements.
5.3.3 Resettlement Policy
The guiding resettlement policies and strategies for the project (for specific project activities as per
requirements) are as follows:





Wherever possible, the sub components will consider the sites that avoid land acquisition and
minimize adverse social impacts.
The resettlement plan should ensure that all PAPs should be able to maintain and if possible
even improve their living.
Develop a mechanism to protect indigenous peoples, socially depressed and economically
vulnerable people like ethnic minorities, women-headed households, and marginal farmers.
The affected people should be entitled for compensation for their lost assets. They should be
paid a replacement cost as agreed between PAF and subproject authorities. In general, the
compensation rate would be based on valuation of the district land acquisition committee
and/or negotiations reached between the parties and witnessed by a third party. VDC officials or
41

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards












District Agriculture Office/DDC can be requested to assume the role of witness as a third party.
Compensation for loss of perennial crops and trees should be calculated as annual net product
value multiplied by number of years for new crop to start producing, Land acquisition process
(see Annex 5.2) could be followed to ensure the replacement value for the land
Ensure resettlement activities as a participatory process by informed participation and frequent
consultation with the SPAP. Provide assistance to SPAF regardless of their ownership as title
holders or non holders. Likewise, assist the displaced people to restore their livelihood and
income generating activities.
If possible, provide “land for land” particularly to the vulnerable groups. Similarly the relocation
should be as close to the previous land/house as possible.
The agreement should ensure that ownership of the compensated land and property is
transferred to the community or the subprojects beneficiary.
The Resettlement Plan Framework shall be implemented in consultation with and in
participation of the affected people. Subproject structures will only start when full
compensation to SPAP for their assets is paid.
If affected land is under tenancy, both the landowners and tenants will be treated as affected
people and will be eligible for entitlements and compensation. Rehabilitation measures for
restoration of the livelihood of SPAPs will be devised under the subproject implementation plan.
The effected people will get priority in employment during project construction works and other
project activities.
Project Resettlement Plan will be translated into Nepali and made available at the local level for
reference. It can be accessed by anybody of the community as and when needed.
A Subproject Implementation Plan (SIP) must include all the cost of resettlement and other
social development activities. Likewise annual allocation, if required, is to be included in the
yearly budget of the subproject.
Functional mechanism will have to be established for seeking and resolving the objections of
the affected people.

5.3.4 Eligibility Criteria
The detailed eligibility criteria of affected people is given in Annex 5,3.The following groups of people,
who have their own lands, are entitled to compensation and assistance under some of the subcomponent's
activities (installation of AMS/AHS/WRS).
Marginal Farmer: Farm families having less than 0.1 ha of land in hills and 0.25 ha in the Terai.
Displaced family: Any tenure holder and his family members, tenant, Government lessee or owner
of property, encroacher or squatter on government land who on account of involuntary
acquisition or taking of the land or other property for the project purpose, has been displaced
from such land or property.
Squatters: People who have occupied land violating the laws and are not entitled to compensation
for lost land under this policy. But, if displaced they are entitled to resettlement assistance as
well as compensation for loss of other assets, such as buildings excluding land.

42

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

Encroachers: People who have trespassed into public/private/community land to which they are
not authorized.
Vulnerable Groups: Distinct groups of socially distressed people who might suffer
disproportionately from the effects of resettlement. These groups can be ethnic minority/
indigenous groups, women headed households, the poor (based on the poverty line), the
disabled, elderly and landless/ families.
5.3.5 Entitlement Matrix
The entitlement matrix describes entitlement of affected households for their loss of land and assets on
land and the responsible organisation for the management of compensation scheme (Table 5.2).
PMU/DHM will carry out land compensation works during implementation of the project by adopting
the entitlement matrix. The costs for the compensation will be estimated by PMU in a close
coordination with CDC during the implementation period. PMU will be responsible to proceed
entitlement activities.

5.4 Framework for Vulnerable Community Development Plan
Indigenous ethnic group (listed by GoN), women, disabled people, Dalits are groups in vulnerable
community. In accordance with the World Bank’s Operational on Indigenous Peoples and relevant GoN
policies a framework for Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP) has been prepared to
define the policy and implementation framework. It addresses the impacts on vulnerable peoples
ensuring meaningful consultations with these people during the implementation of the project
activities. A common approach providing a minimal welfare safety net for vulnerable people in the
project has been planned. Stakeholders’ consultations and social screening during the feasibility stage of
each subcomponent will identify the presence of vulnerable groups in project's activity areas.
5.4.1 Steps for VCDP
The steps to be followed for VCDP are as follows:









Screening to identify whether Indigenous / vulnerable Peoples are present or have collective
attachment to, the project area
Social assessment and analysis by social development professional in collaboration with PMU at
DHM need to be carried out to address the social concerns of the subcomponent area
Identifying views of the affected communities by following a process of free, prior, and
informed consultation at each stage of the project, and particularly during project preparation
Institutional arrangements (including capacity building wherever necessary) for screening
project-supported activities, evaluating their effects on Indigenous Peoples, preparing IPPs (if
required), and addressing grievances
The preparation of Plan
Monitoring and reporting including the establishment of mechanisms and benchmarks
appropriate to the project and
Disclosure of the draft Plan

5.4.2 Capacity Building
 Provide an action plan to address the capacity enhancement needs of vulnerable groups
including indigenous and Dalit community and ensure that they will be able to know real time
information of climate related hazards and adopt mitigation measures.
 DHM and District Agriculture Office (line agencies of MOAD) will be involved in mobilizing the
indigenous people for group formation and strengthening through training. Likewise capable

members of local ethnic groups, including women will be engaged by the concerned agencies of
PMU/DHM to undertake information dissemination works, preparing the beneficiary groups for
project activities and contributory works.
Development of beneficiary groups during the subcomponent implementation will include
social mobilization and information campaign, and skills upgrading.
Representation of the vulnerable groups and their active involvement in project activities during
and post implementation phases will increase their access to the services to be provided by the
project. These groups will also have sufficient opportunities for gaining skills and getting other
benefits of the project, such as income generation, developing capacity for disaster mitigation
etc.
Involvement of local media will uplift the advocacy organization at local level to promote project
benefit on more sustainable manner. It will act as useful tool particularly in the field of DRR and
the application of climate information in sectoral developments.
Mitigation measures will prioritize while addressing the susceptibility of diverse vulnerable
groups including ethnic groups.
PMU will be actively involved in disseminating information on to the target groups beneficiaries
about the key project components, subcomponents, activities, eligibility and selection criteria,
stakeholder involvement, contribution of the project and project implementation process.
Professional support will be provided to PMU through DHM, MoAD and NARC.

5.6. Consultation and Dissemination Strategy Framework
According to Environmental Protection Regulation 1997, consultations with the project's beneficiaries
including local population and NGOs must be conducted ensuring their participation at all stages of
project implementation. These consultations are important particularly when project activities start
directly affecting these communities. Changes in natural and social environment must be made
conditional to the prior consent of the affected communities. Representatives of local communities
affected by the project and NGOs should be involved in consultations.
Public consultations will be conducted during project implementation in compliance with Nepali laws on
NGOs and Media and World Bank Policy on Disclosure of Information21. Consultation framework for
information disclosure has been schematically presented in Figure 5.4.. The project's information such
as sites, scale of impacts- adverse and beneficial social and environmental benefits, sustainability,
monitoring system and the outcome of the project etc need to be compiled.

Relative Humidity Measuring Sensor
Capacitive relative humidity sensors are commonly used and is based on the principle that dielectric
constant change with change in humidity of the atmosphere. The other types are resistive humidity
sensors. The choice of the sensors depends upon the environment at which the measurements are
done.
Wind speed and direction measuring sensor
For the standard meteorological observation wind sensors should be placed in 10m height above the
ground in open terrain. Open terrain is defined as an area where the distance between the anemometer
and any obstruction is at least 10 times the height of the obstruction.
Precipitation Measurement
In automatic weather station especially for rainfall measurements tipping bucket rain gauge are used
and it counts the no of tip for the rainfall measurements. For solid precipitation measurements weighing
rain gauge are used with rim heating.
Temperature measuring Sensor


should be housed in a Ventilated Radiation Shield

XXVI

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards





Should be at least 30 m from large paved areas and can be located in an open level area that’s at
least 9 m in diameter. The open areas should be covered by short grass, or where grass does not
grow, the natural earth.
Need to avoid the followings:
 Large industrial heat sources
 Rooftops
 Steep slopes
 sheltered hollows
 High vegetation
 Shaded areas
 Swamps
 Areas where snow drifts occur
 Low places holding standing water after rains
 Standard Measuring Height: 1.25-2.0m

While selecting the representative sites for precipitation measurement care should be taken on
following points:





The effects on the wind field of the immediate surroundings of the site can give rise to local
excesses and deficiencies in precipitation. In general, objects should not be closer to the gauge
than a distance of twice their height above the gauge orifice.
Sites on a slope or the roof of a building should be avoided.
The best sites are often found in clearings within forests or orchards, among trees, in scrub or
shrub forests, or where other objects act as an effective wind-break for winds from all directions
The surface surrounding the precipitation gauge can be covered with short grass, gravel or
shingle, but hard, flat surfaces, such as concrete, should be avoided to prevent excessive insplashing

The features of the sites of AWOS: Sitting and exposures:



Outdoor instruments should be installed on a level piece of ground, preferably no smaller than
25 m x 25 m where there are many installations, but in cases where there are relatively few
installations the area may be considerably smaller, for example, 10 m x 7 m (the enclosure). The
ground should be covered with short grass or a surface representative of the locality, and
surrounded by open fencing or palings to exclude unauthorized persons. Within the enclosure, a
bare patch of ground of about 2 m x 2 m is reserved for observations of the state of the ground
and of soil temperature at depths of equal to or less than 20 cm
There should be no steeply sloping ground in the vicinity, and the site should not be in a hollow.
If these conditions are not met, the observations may show peculiarities of entirely local
significance;

XXVII







The site should be well away from trees, buildings, walls or other obstructions. The distance of
any such obstacle (including fencing) from the rain gauge should not be less than twice the
height of the object above the rim of the gauge, and preferably four times the height;
The sunshine recorder, rain gauge and anemometer must be exposed according to their
requirements, preferably on the same site as the other instruments;
It should be noted that the enclosure may not be the best place from which to estimate the
wind speed and direction; another observing point, more exposed to the wind, may be
desirable;
Very open sites which are satisfactory for most instruments are unsuitable for rain gauges. For
such sites, the rainfall catch is reduced in conditions other than light winds and some degree of
shelter is needed;
If in the instrument enclosure surroundings, maybe at some distance, objects like trees or
buildings obstruct the horizon significantly, alternative viewpoints should be selected for
observations of sunshine or radiation;

Aviation meteorological stations





The aviation meteorological stations should be representative of the runway field for safety and
comfort of the aviation operations. While keeping the instruments care should be given for
placing the sensors to protect it from artificial effect due to aircraft.
Wind mast which is at 10m height should be frangible type.
There are number of sensors based on laser technology such as ceilometers, present weather
sensors (visibility and present weather) snow depth sensors etc in meteorology but mostly they
are classified as safe by WMO and other related organization.

Data Logger: Memory card, Processor, Sensor channels
Power System: Solar Panel, Back up Battery
Modem: GSM/GPRS or CDMA
Sensors: Water Level Sensor

Weather Radar System (WRS)
Weather RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) used by WMO members may be classified in several
ways due to the criteria of the classification, e.g. receiving and transmitting type, operating frequency
band, polarization type, type of transmitter, Doppler, non-Doppler, etc. The most common classification
and types are described briefly in this part.The mostly used weather radars are C-Band , S-Band and XBand radars respectively.
S-band radars
Those radars operate on a wavelength of 8-15 cm and a frequency of 2-4 GHz. Because of the
wavelength and frequency, S band radars are not easily attenuated. This makes them useful for near and
XXVIII

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

far range weather observation. It requires a large antenna dish and a large motor to power it. S-Band
radars are generally used to detect and track severe weather phenomena in long ranges such as
tornado, hurricane, etc.
C-band radars
Those radars operate on a wavelength of 4-8 cm and a frequency of 4-8 GHz. The signal is more easily
attenuated, so this type of radar is best used for short range weather observation. Also, due to the small
size of the radar, it can therefore be portable. The frequency allows C band radars to create a smaller
beam width using a smaller dish. C band radars also do not require as much power as and S band radar.
C-Band radars are very suitable for precipitation measurements. The new developments on polarimetry
have made them very capable for hydrometeor classification.
X-band radars
Those radars operate on a wavelength of 2.5-4 cm and a frequency of 8-12 GHz. Because of the smaller
wavelength, the X band radar is more sensitive and can detect smaller particles. These radars are used
for studies on cloud development because they can detect the tiny water particles and also used to
detect light precipitation. X band radars also attenuate very easily, so they are used for only very short
range weather observation. Most of the terminal Doppler weather radars are chosen as X-Band radars
by considering their structure and features. Furthermore, X-Band is very suitable for mobile radar
applications.

Annex 3.1: Policies and Framework of Government of Nepal and the World
Bank's Safeguard Policies in details
a) Environment Planning &Management, Information Management and Agriculture Promotion
Environment Protection Act 1997 and Regulations 1997 and National EIA Guidelines 1993: The
Environmental Protection Act and Rules deal with the conduction of Initial Environment Examination
(IEE) for smaller or Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for larger projects. Any development project,
before implementation, should pass through environmental assessment, which may be either IEE or EIA
depending upon the location, type and size of the projects. It requires the concerned
organization/agency forward IEE or EIA Report to the concerned Ministry and the Ministry of
Environment, Science and Technology (MOEST) for approval. As per the provisions all EIA Reports are to
be approved by MOEST and the information should be made available to public, and all IEE reports are
to be approved by the concerned Ministry. The Act empowers the ministry for settling the standards and
control of pollution. With the provision explained in the Act, the ministry shall issue provisional or
permanent pollution control certificate to industries. It also empowers for setting complaints
procedures for non-compliance of standards. It also facilitates to constitute Environment Protection
Council to provide policy directives or suggestions to Government for protection of environment.
National Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines, 1993: In order to integrate the environmental
aspects in development Projects and programs, the government has developed the National EIA
Guidelines (1993). The guidelines provide criteria for project screening and Environment Impact
assessment (EIA). This includes scoping, preparation of terms of reference for EIA, methods of EIA report
,impact identification and prediction, impact mitigation measures, review of the draft EIA report, impact
monitoring, evaluation of impact studies, impact auditing, community participation and schedules and
annexes to IEE and EIA. Many of the guideline provisions are now included in the Environment
Protection act, 1997 and Environment protection regulation, 1997. EIA in Nepal has now become legally
mandatory.
Environmental Guidelines for Small Rural Infrastructure Planning, 2057: The directive is focused on the
practical implementation of small rural infrastructures through the minimization of environmental
impacts. This directive includes the simple methods of environmental management in the different
phases of the project cycle. More emphasis is given to prevent rather than cure. So, the
recommendations for the mitigation measures are provided only when it is necessary.

Forest Act 1992 and Regulation 1995: The use of forestland for infrastructure Project is subject to forest
law and regulation. The bridge Projects need to comply with the provisions of forest law when it
requires the use of forestland for construction. The Act requires decision makers to take account of all
forest values, including environmental services and biodiversity, not just the production of timber and
other commodities. The Act, 1993 empowers the government in case of no alternatives, to provide parts
of any types of forests for the implementation of a national priority plan with assurance that it does not
adversely affect the environment significantly The act and rules call for carrying out EIA /IEE of the
development proposals if they are to be implemented in the forest areas and/or passes through it.
Section (68) of the Act empowers government to give consent to use any part or the any category of
forest areas, in case of absence of alternative, for the implementation of the national priority proposal
with the assurance that it does not pose any significant adverse effect in the environment. Similarly, the
Act authorizes the government to provide part of national, protected, community or leasehold forest,
which is absolutely necessary for implementation of national priority projects. It facilitates organizing
users' group to manage forests. Section 49 of the Act prohibits reclaiming lands, setting fires, grazing,
removing or damaging forest products, felling trees or plants, wildlife hunting and extracting boulders,
sand and soil from the national forest without prior approval. Forest Regulation, 1995 Rule 65 of the
Forest Regulation stipulates that in case the execution of any project having national priority in any
forest area causes any loss or harm to any local individual or community the proponents of the project
itself shall bear the amount of compensation to be paid. Similarly, the entire expenses required for the
cutting and transporting the forest products in a forest area to be used by the approved project shall be
borne by the proponents of the project.
Aquatic Animal Protection Act, 1961 and First Amendment, 1998: This Act is one of the oldest acts in
Nepal that recognizes the value of wetlands and aquatic animals. The act promulgated for protecting
aquatic animals in natural water bodies like rivers, reservoirs and lakes has remained virtually defunct
due to lack of related bylaws/regulations. Its first amendment in 1998 section 5a states for use of safe
pesticides use for catching aquatic life. Section 4a, 4b and 5 empower the government to prohibit
catching, killing and harming certain kind of aquatic animals in different scenario.
The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973 and Conservation Area Management Rule
1996: The act is the key legal instrument in protecting biodiversity within the protected areas. Section 5
of the Act prohibits, inter alia, hunting of animals or bird, building any house, hut or other structure,
clearing or cultivating any part of the land, harvesting, and cutting, burning or damaging any tree, bush
or other forest products, mining within National Parks and or Wildlife Reserves. Section 5(j) of the act
also prohibits blocking, diverting any river or stream flowing though National Park or Reserve, or any
other source of water, or using any harmful or explosive materials therein. Section 10 of the act provides
protection status of 27 species of mammals, 9 species of birds and 3 species of reptiles. The Act
recognizes six categories of protected areas, namely National Park, Conservation Area, Wildlife Reserve,
Hunting Reserve, Strict Nature Reserve and Buffer Zones.



Use of any harmful poison or exclusive substances into the river, stream or source of water
flowing in the buffer zone
Hunting illegally and any acts damaging to wildlife
Rule 18 of the regulations empowers the warden to give order to stop or rectify certain
activities. This concerns operating activities or planned actions within or outside the buffer zone
that have or will have a negative effect on land use, public health, natural environment or
natural resource conservation. On recommendation of the user’s committee, the warden may,
give an order to the concerned person or institution to stop such activities immediately or to
mitigate the impacts.

Conservation Area Management Rule, 1996: The rule framed under the Nation Park and Wildlife
Conservation Act, 1993 contain provisions for the mobilization of Conservation Area Management
Committee (Rule 8) and the Local User Groups in natural resource management. It calls for the
formulation and implementation of the management plans by detailing activities for natural resource
management, wildlife conservation and their sustainable utilization (Rule 13). The rules prohibit
activities such as wildlife hunting and damage to flora and fauna within the conservation area (Rule16).
As per rule 17, the conservation officer may prohibit any activity, which changes the land use and affect
the public health, natural environment and natural resources of conservation area. In addition, any
person willing to perform commercial activity within the conservation area should obtain permission
(Rule 21). Any person utilizing the resource against the rule is liable to pay the charges as determined by
the committee (Rule 25). According to this rule, any activity that should be carried out should comply
with the working plan.
The Water Resources Act 1993: The act contains provisions to minimize environmental impacts,
including soil erosion, floods and landslides. This provision calls for carrying out EIA study prior to
project implementation (Section 20). The Act also empowers government to frame standards while
utilizing water resources (Section 18) and to frame rules on environment related matters and controlling
pollution (Section 24). Also, in a process for resolving any conflict, the Water Resources Utilization
Investigation Committee should consider environmental impacts likely to occur from a proposal [Rule 28
(3)]. The Irrigation Rules, 1989, prohibits activities, which pollute the canal or irrigation water (Rule 4.1)
Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization Act, 1987: This act categorizes harmful hazardous
wastes and provides controlling measure. It makes provision to appoint inspection officer for checking
and monitoring solid waste control and management with power to take action against the polluter or
polluting agency. The Inspection Officer is empowered to issue directive to any industrial or commercial
centre or individual to clean and throw away the wastes liable to harm the public health. The Inspection
Officer coordinates with the local government to control pollution in land, water and air by managing
commercial wastes. No direct discharge of effluents from the industries, hospitals and nursing homes is
allowed. There is penalty of Rs.50 to 1,000 for violations.
Natural Calamity Act, 1982: The act deals with relief operations and protection of lives and properties.
Furthermore, rehabilitation of disaster victims, protection of life and property and preparation and
adoption of preventive measures like Early Warning System (EWS) etc are addressed in this act.
According to the act, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) is designated as the lead agency responsible

XXXII

for implementation of the Natural Calamity Act, 1982 and is the responsible for rescue, relief works,
data collection and dissemination of resources and information.
The Nepal Environmental Policy and Action Plan (NEPAP), 1993 was the first comprehensive policy
document on environment and development. Prior to this policy document the government had
endorsed in 1992 the National Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines, which was published a
year later in 1993. It was prepared in response to the growing global awareness about the importance of
maintaining the balance between economic development and environmental conservation. Considering
the NCS mandatory and constraint on policy and plan for the preparation of EIAs in Seventh Five Year
Plan., first National EIA Guideline was endorsed in September 1992 and gazette in July 1993.NEPA
provides with an outline of the main features of Nepal’s environmental policy. They are:







Manage natural and physical resources efficiently and sustainably;
Balance development efforts and environmental conservation for sustainable fulfillment of the
basic needs of the people; Safeguard national heritage;
Mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of development projects and human actions;
Integrate environment and development through appropriate institutions, adequate legislation
and economic incentives, and sufficient public resources;
Foster environmental education and awareness at all levels; and
Facilitate participatory involvement of private sector, NGOs, international non-government
organizations (INGOs), and civil society with government efforts in environmental protection

National Agriculture policy 2004: It gives special priority to development of pockets of high-value
agricultural products. The local bodies will be delegated with the rights and responsibilities of
formulation, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of agricultural plans. Farmers' group will be
utilized to provide on-site extension services and resource centers will be developed and strengthened
for producing local seeds, seedlings, plants and improved breeds. Such centers will be gradually
integrated, and will be made capable of operating laboratory services in fields such as soil analysis, seed
certification, crop protection and livestock diagnosis. Special facilities for target groups (oppressed,
depressed classes, marginal farmers, and agricultural workers) will be developed by creating
opportunities for gaining access to lands and contractual farm lands. The District Agricultural
Development Committee and Agricultural Committee formed at district and village level will assist the
local bodies in implementing and monitoring the policies. Safety Nets will be developed for those
farmers who hold lands less than 0.5 hector and lack of year-round irrigation facilities and also for
landless and marginalized communities when weather and disaster occurs.
Information and Communication Policy, 2059: The policy highlights long-term policies on information
and communication sector. The policy gives a high priority to develop the information and
communications sector up to the rural level in a coordinative and competitive manner, while using
proper modern technology and means of communications invented in the world at the moment.

Climate Change Policy GoN, 2001:The policy addresses climate adaption and disaster risk reduction by
Monitoring the status of glaciers and glacier lakes through studies and implement adaptation activities
in priority vulnerable glaciers; Forecasting water-induced disasters and risks created from climate
change and providing early warning information, developing necessary mechanism for the
implementation of preventive measures and ensuring regular supervision, and enhancing capacity;
Identifying the people, communities and areas impacted by climate change and implementing
adaptation and impact mitigation measures based on local knowledge, skills and technologies;
Formulating and implementing integrated programmes taking into consideration the objectives and the
provisions of the conventions related to climate change, desertification and biodiversity; Developing a
necessary mechanism for forecasting and preventing vector-borne, infectious and communicable

cooperation for risk reduction and adaptation to address the effects of climate change in the
international trans-boundary areas.

Himalayan National Parks Regulations, 1979: The regulations have made special provisions for the
people living in the park enclaves to collect natural resources to fulfil daily necessities such as firewood,
leaf litter, small pieces of timber and fodder. These regulations allow people to continue to graze their
domestic cattle on the park rangeland. They can also help reduce the number of "outsiders" or even
stop their entry into the park/reserve to harvest resources, and thus help reduce the exploitation
pressure on the park/reserve.
The Tourism Act, 1978: The act contains provisions to minimize waste and environmental pollution in
the trekking areas. Scattered regulatory measures are also available in other sectorial laws but they do
not clearly spell out the need for EIA studies.
The Mines and Minerals Rules, 2000: It obliges the proponent to adopt environmental protection
measures and ensure environmental conservation (Rule 19). Furthermore, the rules 32 and 33 elaborate
provisions to minimize significant environmental impacts. This Rule provides an opportunity to identify
potential environmental impacts and implement mitigation measures, which is a part of the EIA process.
The Explosives Act, 2018: It is expected that explosives will be used during the construction of the
Project. Hence, the provision of the Explosive Act, 2018 also needs to be taken into consideration.
Section-3 of the Act states that GoN may declare any substance as explosives through a notification in
the Nepal Gazette. Section 4 forbids producing, storing, using, carrying and importing explosives without
a license. The Section also provides the person to apply for the license to the Chief District Officer with
prescribed descriptions.
Plant Protection Act, 2029 (1972) and Rules, 2031(1974): It makes a provision for establishing labs,
checkpoints and quarantine stations. The rules make treatment requirement of plants before import

purpose of regulating their use; restriction for selling designated seeds the species or variety of which is
not identifiable or do not fulfill the minimum condition of germination or purity; permit necessary for
import or export of designated seeds; standard formats for approval or release of new breed,
registration, ownership of new seeds and export and import of seeds.
Chemical Fertilizer (Regulatory) Order, 2055(1998): The Order was issued under the power granted by
the Essential Commodities Control Act, 1960. Regulatory provisions include procedures for import,
manufacture or mixing, quality control and penalties. The Fertilizer Board has been given the authority
to advise the government in the formulation of policy, priorities, specifications, and quality control;
setting a system of quality control before the entry of fertilizers into the country and at the point of
distribution; and permit for manufacturing or mixing of fertilizers in the country. Manufacturer needs to
obtain a certificate from an independent surveyor about the specifications of the fertilizers
manufactured and the dealers have to register and provide information about the sales to the District
Agriculture Development Office.
Animal Feeds Act, 2033 (1976) : This Act prohibits production, sale, export and import or storage of
contaminated and polluted feeds; prohibit selling of feeds by falsely claiming a different product or
higher in quality. Government has to set a minimum standard of feed. Appeal may be made to the

Land Acquisition Act, 2034 (1977), Land Acquisition Regulations, 2026 (1969) amended in 1992: This act
and regulation empowers the government to acquire land for development purposes, by paying
compensation to the landowner. The act clearly empowers the government to acquire necessary land at
any place in any quantity by giving the compensation for the land required for any public purpose or for
operation of any development project initiated by government institution (Section 3 and 4).
Furthermore, government may decide to have the land acquired for any institution, in case such
institution requests the Government for acquisition of land for any of the following purposes subject to
payment of compensation and all other expenses under this Act:


Construction of residential quarters for the staff, workers or labourers of the institution, or
undertake any function in the interest of the general public,
 Project connected with an institution fully owned by the Government
The term “public purposes” means functions undertaken in the interest of or for the benefit or use of
the general public projects approved by the Government, and projects undertaken by Village
Development Committees (VDCs), Municipalities and District Development Committees (DDCs).
While determining the amount of compensation for land to be acquired for institutions other than VDCs,
Municipalities, DDCs, and institutions fully owned by Government, the compensation fixation committee
shall take the following matters into consideration:




The price of land at the time of the publication of the notice for land acquisition
The value of the crop, houses, walls, sheds etc if any acquired along with the land
The losses which the concerned person would suffer as a result of acquisition having been
required to shift his residence or the place of his business by reason of the acquisition of his
land.
There is also provision to acquire land through negotiation; the government can acquire land for the
purpose of public work by directly negotiating with the owner.
The Government shall provide compensation to the concerned person and organization as decided by
the Compensation Fixation Committee. The committee consists of Chief District Officer, Chief District
Land Administration and Revenue Officer, Project Chief and the Representative of the DDC. The
compensation paid under this Act will be in cash. However, under the Section 14 of the Act it is stated
that, the Government may allot land to those people whose land has been acquired, from the land it
possess such as Ailani, or Government-owned any other land, and if they prefer land for land.

Land Acquisition Guidelines under the Land Acquisition Act2034 (1977) empowers government to
acquire any land, on the payment of compensation, for public purposes and works. This policy is
supplemented by guidelines and procedures for land acquisition. Land acquisition processes including
required time are given in the report (Annex 3.3.).
Two sets of guidelines related to land acquisition are significant for RAIP. They are the Land Acquisition
Guidelines of 1989 and guidelines issued by HMGN pursuant to section 16 and 17 of the Land
Acquisition Act 2034 in 1977. These guidelines specify two categories of affected families, Project
Affected Families (PAF) and Seriously Project Affected Family (SPAF). A PAF consists of the members of a
household including elderly dependents and minor children (under 18 years of age) residing under one
roof and operating as a single economic unit, who are adversely affected by the project. SPAF is defined
as a family who loses over 25% of its total land holdings or whose land is reduced to an uneconomic
holding (less than 5.0 katha) or who is being displaced. Under these guidelines the concerned officials,
with the assistance of the project team, are to carry out assessments of project affected families to
identify their standard of living and types of assets. Valuation of land and asset lost were to be based on
comparative market values of similar assets in the vicinity. The guidelines also included arrangements
for rehabilitation of project affected families. For PAF’s, the compensation package includes cash for
assets acquired or damaged by the project and a rehabilitation grant to cover any suffering and
hardship. For SPAF’s, the compensation additionally include employment for one family member and
provision of skill training. The Guidelines specify the establishment of an Acquisition and Rehabilitation
Committee (also known as Compensation Fixation Committee, “CFC”) consisting of the concerned Chief
District Officer (Chair), Land Revenue Officer, representative of the District Panchayat (now DDC) and
the Project Manager and others as deemed necessary. The Committee is responsible for acquiring land
and paying compensation. In 1993, a second set of guidelines reduced the Acquisition and Rehabilitation
Committee to a four-member Compensation Fixation and Rehabilitation Management Committee by
dropping the Land Revenue Officer and other appointees by GoN. The functions and powers of the
committee were clarified as were methods of payment and means of ensuring fair valuation of land
quality.

National Policy on Land acquisition, Compensation and Resettlement, 2006: The policy describes about
the indigenous people, vulnerable groups, project affected persons, and seriously project affected
persons/families in the context of compensation and resettlement. This policy recognizes compensation
at replacement cost for the loss of land, assets or income of affected persons and their relocation. This
policy outlines the resettlement principles.
Guthi (Religious Trust Land) Corporation Act, 1976: According to the act, the land acquisition must
comply with the provisions of the Guthi Corporation Act. Section 42 of this Act makes it clear that
Religious Trust Land acquired for development purpose must be replaced with land instead of being
compensated in cash.

XXXVII

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

The Act for National Academy for Uplift of Adivasi / Janajati Act 2058 (2002) : This Act has defined
“nationalities” (Aadivasi) and indigenous people (Janajati) as people having their own mother tongue,
distinct traditional cultural identities and social structure. This definition apparently is very close to the
World Bank definitions on the indigenous people. The Act has enlisted 59 such caste / ethnic groups
prevailing in Nepal.
Local Self Governance Act, 2055 (1999): This act provides more autonomy to District Development
Committees, Municipalities and Village Development Committee. The Act empowers the VDCs, DDCs
and Municipalities to conserve manage and use their natural resources and collect tax, revenue from the
sale and use of such resources and use it for local development. Section 220 of the Act has provisions for
revenue sharing with DDC, natural resources, including water resources. There are provisions relating to
agriculture development; it authorizes the local bodies to plan and carry out agricultural development
programme and arrange agricultural Haat (village market). It facilitates the development and operation
of Veterinary Hospitals, and development of pastures for livestock grazing.
The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007: The Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007) includes provisions
that support gender equality and social inclusion. It has a separate article for women’s fundamental
rights (Article 20) and is more inclusive toward Janajatis, Dalits, and Madhesis. As per article 20 of the
the Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 “no woman shall be discriminated against in any way on the
basis of gender” It sets forth the right to equality and to rights against untouchability, racial
discrimination, and exploitation (e.g., forced labor). It also authorizes the State to implement measures
for the “protection, empowerment and advancement of women, Dalits, indigenous nationalities, and
Madhesis” (Article 13). Similarly, the 2007 amendment to the Civil Service Act reserves 45% of vacant
posts for excluded groups, allocated as follows: women (33%), ethnic groups (27%), Madhesis (22%),
Dalits (9%), differently abled (5%), and backward regions (4%) to increase the effectiveness and
responsiveness of the civil service.
Gender and Child Rights Mainstreaming Guidelines 2005: This guidelines was approved by the Cabinet
of GON in 2061 (2005), aiming at enhancing gender equality and promoting the mainstreaming of
gender and child rights, and welfare works in local level. Women Development Office (WDO) was
appointed as Focal Point Agency and Women Development Officer is referred to the Chief of Focal Point
Agency. Working areas of the Focal Point Agency are; a) Networking, b) Mainstreaming, c) Facilitation, d)
Coordination, e) Contact Services, and f) Follow-up and Evaluation.
Land Act, 2021(1964) and Rules, 2021(1964): The Land Act and Rules limit land holding of a person or
family as landowner. As per the Act the maximum ceiling one can hold depends upon the location of
land in ecological regions of the country-10 bigha (about 6ha), 25 ropanis (1.25ha) and 70 ropanis
(3.5ha) in Terai, Kathmandu Valley and hills, respectively. It also puts a ceiling on tenants for holding
land up to 4 bighas, 10 ropanis and 20 ropanis in Terai, Kathmandu Valley and hills, respectively. This Act
exempts institutions such as government, local bodies, medical and educational, Guthi (Trust land) and
foreign agencies enjoying diplomatic facility from ceiling of ownership of land. It allows land holding
above the ceiling for industrial and agricultural purposes under certain condition and as prescribed by
XXXVIII

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

the government, and also allows cooperative societies to hold land above the ceiling as prescribed by
the government. Furthermore, it authorizes the government to implement a programme for control of
land fragmentation and consolidation of land. It provides appropriate facilities as required to a group of
ten or more landowners who want to implement cooperative farming for increasing agricultural
production. It provides procedures for consolidation of land and authorizes the government not to allow
fragmentation below a certain unit of land in the area where the programme for control of
fragmentation and consolidation of land has been started. The Act has made provisions to make
facilities available for farmers wishing to adopt cooperative farming.
Legal Aid Act 1998: The act seeks to improve access of the economically under-privileged and other
disadvantaged groups like Dalit, women and other ethnic groups to justice system.
Labour Act 1992: The act makes provision for a healthy, safe and secure environment for workers. It
directs industries or any enterprise to arrange proper residence facility for workers. Enterprises have to
set aside obligatorily 5% of gross profit for workers residence. Industries require waste management
and the control of noise pollution in the working area. As per this Act, only Nepalese citizens can be
employed on a permanent basis in any enterprise and the industries employing non-Nepalese specialists
on a contract basis would need permission from the Labour department. Matters relating to workplace
conditions including workplace standards, protections for working women and vulnerable people, and
minimum wages are governed by this act and Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1999.
According to Section 16 an employee or worker has to work 48 hours per week. He/She is allowed a
break of 30 minutes in a day. Section 21 of the Labour Act authorizes the government to fix minimum
wages of workers and employees upon recommendation of the Minimum Wages Fixation Committee
consisting of equal number of representatives of workers or employees, owner of the enterprise and the
Government. The Government, by publishing a notice in Nepal Gazette in August 2006, has fixed the
minimum wages of different categories of workers.
Working Conditions: Matters relating to workplace conditions including workplace standards,
protections for working women and vulnerable people, and minimum wages are governed by Labour
Act, 1991 and Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1999.
Working hours: An employee or worker has to work 48 hours per week. He/She is allowed a break of 30
minutes in a day (Section 16, Labour Act (LA), 1999).
Workplace conditions: The owner should provide a clean and tidy workplace to workers (Sec. 27, LA)
and safety against fire (Sec. 30, LA). Minors (16 to 18 years of age) should not be engaged at work
without adequate direction and training (Sec. 32A, LA).
Housing: The owner should allocate not less than 5% of the gross profit to make provision for housing
(Sec. 41, LA). Workers of the Tea Estate should be provided with housing facilities for workers who do
not have a house close to the factory site (Sec. 45, LA).
Protections for working women and vulnerable people

XXXIX

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

Working hours: Minors (Between 16 to 18 years of age) and females may be engaged in work normally
between 6 AM to 6 PM (Sec. 5, LA). Females may be deployed at work in a hotel and travel agency
beyond the regular hours by making special arrangements for safety according to the nature of work
(Sec. 48, LA).
Minimum Wage: Section 21 of the Labour Act authorizes the government to fix minimum wages of
workers and employees upon recommendation of the Minimum Wages Fixation Committee consisting
of equal number of representatives of workers or employees, owner of the enterprise and the
Government.
Child Labour
Section 2 of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1999 (CLA) defines child as someone who
is below the age of 16 years. Section 3 of the CLA prohibits employment of a child below 16 years of age
as worker. It prohibits employing a child in hazardous work. The Act includes services such as
workshops, labs, slaughterhouses, cold storages as hazardous work. It also includes work such as
manufacturing or production of pesticides and collection of solid wastes in the list of hazardous work.
Production of biogas is also included in the list of hazardous work or enterprises.
Prohibition and Regulation Act, 1999 : The act defines child as someone who is below the age of 16
years. Section 3 of the CLA prohibits employment of a child below 16 years of age as worker. It prohibits
employing a child in hazardous work. The Act includes services such as workshops, labs,
slaughterhouses, cold storages as hazardous work. It also includes work such as manufacturing or
production of pesticides and collection of solid wastes in the list of hazardous work. Production of
biogas is also included in the list of hazardous work or enterprises.
First Five Year Plan (1956-1961): The plan was the first planned process of development in Nepal while
Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-1985) had first mentioned the need for EIA for major infrastructure projects.
Government had established a project entitled “Environmental Impact Study Project” (EISP) under the
Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation in 1982. During 1982 to 1988, EISP prepared draft documents
on environmental policy, environmental act and guidelines and conducted EIA on several ongoing
infrastructure projects. However, the efforts at project level became ineffective, due to lack of interest
of the decision-makers and the politicians (Bhattarai, 1999).
Seventh Five Year Plan (1985-1990), first time a national level policy on environment management was
incorporated. The policy emphasized to carry out EIA for all major development projects such as
tourism, water resources, infrastructure, forestry and industry. However, implementation of EIA policy
was not realized to the extent previewed. EIA was carried out in hydro-power development, irrigation
and drinking water and road construction without mandatory requirement of the Government, though,
but rather as a requirement stipulated by loan and donor agencies. The Nepal Government/National
Planning Commission (NPC) and International Union for Conservation of Natures (IUCN) developed and
endorsed the National Conservation Strategy (NCS) in this period for sustainable management of natural
resources and the protection of the environment. The NCS for Nepal was prepared jointly as an interXL

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

sectoral umbrella policy at the national level for addressing environmental issues during the
development process.
Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-1995): The plan reemphasized the need for an EIA system to integrate
environmental concerns into the development process. The Eight Five Year Plan anticipated the
establishment of a national system for EIA and stipulated that EIA be conducted at the stage of
feasibility study.

Ninth Five Year Plan (1998-2003)
A participatory EIA system
Poverty alleviation as the main objective
Integration of economy and ecology
Emphasized to make necessary procedures for the involvement of local bodies, communities, private
sector, NGOs and government agencies
Focused on the need for conducting EIA study in order to ensure biodiversity conservation while
implementing development projects in remote area
Institutional strengthening and legal provision
Use of economic instruments
Industry-specific discharge standards for water and air and appropriate compliance plan for industries
Establishment of national environmental data bank and easy access to public
Environmental programmes with the involvement of women and poverty-stricken people
Resettlement Policy Status in Nepal: Nepal's history of resettlement policy started with the
establishment of Rapti Development Board in 1956. Supported by US assistance, it was meant to
resettle flood victims of 1955 in Chitwan Valley by bringing forest land under cultivation. In 1963, Nepal
Resettlement Company was established under the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The company
executed resettlement programs in the Tarai districts of Banke, Nawal Parasi and Jhapa. After five years
of establishing Nepal Resettlement Company, a Resettlement Department was established within the
same Ministry. The department mainly executed resettlement of displaced people on forest land
designated for clearance with ten regional offices. For some time, both these agencies existed
simultaneously and performed overlapping functions at times. The project specific policies for
involuntary resettlement have resulted in disparities between Government funded projects and donorfinanced projects. These discrepancies have given rise to clear discrimination in the provision of

XLI

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

compensation packages and resettlement schemes among people affected by these projects. Likewise,
the following are some of the areas and issues that the LAA 1977 overlooks:
it has no provisions for granting compensation to project affected people lacking ownership of land;
It does not address hardship caused from delays in payment of compensation for several years after the
completion of the project;
The LAA1977 lacks in mechanisms to ensure ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups—Adivasis/Janjati,
Dalits and women—use compensation money in a manner that would enable them to restore their
living standards at least to levels prior to the project; and
It does not analyze the limitation of land for land compensation.
Tenth Periodic Plan (2002-2007) : The plan seeks to reduce poverty from 38% to 30% by 2007 through
emphasis on four key areas, high, sustainable, and broad based economic growth, social sector and rural
infrastructure development; targeted program for the ultra-poor, vulnerable and deprived groups; and
good governance. This plan includes genetic resources and biodiversity conservation programs in
sustainable manner.
Tenth Five Year Plan, 2003 Conservation of biodiversity through management of buffer zone involving
local user groups, promote & encourage Eco-tourism in the protected areas. Conservation of biological
diversity will be achieved through the utilization of landscape approach, community participation, and
soil conservation in sustainable way forming basis for development,
Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08 – 2009/10)
Long term Vision: To achieve sustainable economic development by reducing environmental impacts
Objectives: To carry out economic development by reducing pressure on the environment through
implementation of international conventions and agreements
Policies and working policies adopted in the three-year interim plan are as follows:
Formulation and implementation of an integrated policy related to environment.
Adoption of environmental standards and widening implementation of cleaner production, energy
efficiency, environmental monitoring and auditing works
Formulation, implementation and monitoring of the programs in accordance to the treaties,
conventions and agreements on environment that are endorsed by and to which a Nepal is a party

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

National Action Plan on Disaster Management, 1996 emphasizes all phase of the disaster risk
management: preparedness, response, reconstruction & rehabilitation and mitigation to deal natural
disasters.
Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08 – 2009/10): Nepal’s Constitution does not permit discrimination on
the basis of sex and advocates special legal provisions to protect and advance the interests of women.
The Interim Constitution of 2007 includes women's rights, gender equality and the empowerment of
women as important liabilities and responsibilities of the State in legal and moral terms. (“Three Year
Interim Plan 2007/08-2009/10”, NPC, p. 102). In the Three Year Interim Plan, Chapter eight highlights
the issues of women and socially disadvantaged groups (vulnerable groups) and describes the problems,
challenges, objectives, strategies, approaches and programs to target following six social groups.
I) Empowerment of Women and Gender Equality
The objectives are to build and equitable and gender inclusive society by ensuring equal rights of women
of all castes, creed and regions. To achieve these objectives, policy and legal reforms as well as other
necessary measures will be taken to ensure at least 33 % representation of women in the policy and
decision making process at all levels. Tasks will be undertaken to create strong environment, including
legal framework to end all kinds of violence and gender discrimination against women. A special
program will be run to protect the rights of conflict victims and internally displaced women, and to
rehabilitate them. Active and meaningful participation of women in conflict resolution and peace
building will be ensured.
ii) Upliftment and Development of Dalits
The objective is to increase the access of Dalits to the social and economic resources and thereby
promote their representation and influence in proportion to the population. The strategies are to
reform state structure, policies and rules to eliminate the constraints of Dalits upliftment.
iii) Adibasi Janajati
The objective is to promote economic and cultural development of Adibasi Janajatis by increasing their
access to the administrative, social and economic resources. The strategies are to reform existing state
structure, laws and policies which present hindrances to the promotion of interests of Adibasi Janajatis.
iV) Madhesi Community Development
The objective is to improve living standard of the Madhesi community by increasing their access to the
administrative, social and economic resources in proportion to their population. The strategies are to
revise state machinery, policies and rules to remove the hindrances of policy and structural nature to
integrate Madhesi community in all state organs. Other backward class is also included in this group.
V) Muslim Community

XLIII

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

The objective is to increase access of Muslim community to social and economic resources and to
increase their representation in proportion in the state organs. The strategy is to achieve proportionate
representation of Muslim community in decision process and decision making mechanism.
Vi) Persons with Disability
The objective is to create persons with disability-friendly environment, free of obstacles and enabling
them to access to all possible facilities for a just, dignified and independent livelihood. The strategies are
to build legal, institutional, physical and economic infrastructure, to empower persons with disability
economically, socially and politically.

Local Bodies Gender Budget Audit Guideline 2008: This guideline was approved by Ministry of Local
Development in May, 2008, aiming at institutionalizing and promoting the system of equitable
development gender mainstreaming in Local Bodies and its partner organization’s policy and programs.
The specific objectives are:
To institutionalize gender mainstreaming in annual and periodic plan of LBs
To incorporate the gender inclusion goal in the structure and plan of action of LBs
To monitor and evaluate the LBs resources mobilization, budget allocation and expenditure
To contribute to Millennium Development Goals
To institutionalize gender responsive good governance system
The scope of work are ; a) disaggregated data, b) gender mainstreaming, c)gender responsive capacity
building, d) ensuring program and budget, e) facilitation, f) Coordination, g) guidance, h) monitoring and
evaluation, i) gender budget audit, j) gender analysis and self evaluation, k) good governance, l)
exchange of experiences and learning , and m) documentation.
Gender and disadvantaged groups related budget guidelines: National Planning Commissions (NPC)
issues budget guidelines with close coordination with Ministry of Finance. Several guidelines and
schemes have been put into effect regarding budgetary regulations. They include:
i)Expanded Block Grant Guideline, DDC, 2065: It earmarks 30% of total DDC budget for projects to
benefit women and disadvantaged groups. At least the Grant earmarks 15% of capital budget for
programs for women, Dalits, Adibasi Janajati, the disabled, Madhesi, Muslims, backward caste groups,
the elderly, children and youth. The challenge will be in ensuring that the implementation does not
dilute its effectiveness.
ii) Local Bodies Gender Budget Audit Guideline, 2064 issued by MLD and approved by GON and Ministry
of Finance, guiding how to do gender audit. This guideline is comprehensive and covers many aspects of

XLIV

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

mainstreaming gender into the planning and program cycle of local bodies. However, it is limited to
gender aspects alone and does not provide specific guidance on how to do Gender Mainstreaming and
Social Inclusion (GM/SI) responsive budgeting from the holistic point of view. The Ministries and districts
have yet to practice gender-responsive budgeting on an institutional basis.
World Bank Safeguard Policies
The World Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies concern of its support to sustainable
poverty reduction. The objective of these polices is to examine the potential environmental risks and
benefits associated with Bank investment lending operations. It is an essential tool for integrating
environmental and social concerns into development policies, programs and projects by providing
minimum requirements that all Bank-supported operations must meet.
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01): It is conducted to ensure that Bank-financed projects are
environmentally sound and sustainable, and that decision-making is improved through appropriate
analysis of actions and of their likely environmental impacts. EA evaluates a project's potential
environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence; examines project alternatives; identifies ways of
improving project selection, planning, design, and implementation by preventing, minimizing,
mitigating, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and
includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout project
implementation. EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health
and safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property); and
trans-boundary and global environmental aspects. It also takes into account the variations in project and
country conditions; the findings of country environmental studies; national environmental action plans;
the country's overall policy framework, national legislation, and institutional capabilities related to the
environment and social aspects; and obligations of the country, pertaining to project activities, under
relevant international environmental treaties and agreements. The Bank does not finance project
activities that would breach such country obligations, as identified during the EA.
World Bank undertakes environmental screening of the project to determine the appropriate extent and
type of Environmental Assessment (EA).
Forestry (OP/BP 4.36): This policy aims to reduce deforestation, enhance the environmental
contribution of rested areas, promote afforestation, reduce poverty and encourage economic
development. The Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinion, would involve significant
conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical natural habitats. This policy aims to
reduce deforestation, enhance the environmental contribution of forested areas, promote afforestation,
reduce poverty, and encourage economic development
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04 ): This policy affirms WB’s commitment to promote and support natural
habitat conservation and improved land use, and the protection and rehabilitation of natural habitats
and their functions in project financing. Natural habitats comprise many types of terrestrial, freshwater,
coastal, and marine ecosystems. They include areas lightly modified by human activities, but retaining

their ecological functions and native species.. WB does not support projects that involve significant
conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12):The key objectives of the World Bank's policy on involuntary
land acquisition are to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement where feasible, exploring all viable
alternative project designs; assist displaced persons in improving their former living standards, income
earning capacity, and production level, or at least, in restoring them; encourage community
participation in planning and implementing resettlement; and provide assistance to affected people
regardless of the legality of land tenure. The policy provides guidelines for mitigating the adverse effects
of development projects including social and environmental impacts such as land acquisition, relocation,
loss of occupations and income sources, productive assets as well as community resources. The policy
covers not only physical relocation, but any loss of land or other assets resulting in relocation or loss of
shelter; loss of assets or access to assets; loss of income sources or means of livelihood whether or not
the affected people must move to another location. When the policy is triggered, Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) must be prepared. An abbreviated plan may be developed when less than 200 people are
affected by the project. In situations where all the precise impacts cannot be assessed during project
preparation, provision is made for preparing a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The RAP/RPF must
ensure that all the Bank’s policy provisions detailed in OP 4.12 are addressed particularly the payment of
compensation for affected assets at their replacement cost.
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11):The key objective of this policy is to assist in preserving
Physical Cultural Resources (PCR) and in avoiding their destruction or damage. PCR includes resources of
archeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious (including graveyards and burial sites),
aesthetic, or other cultural .Cultural resources are important as sources of valuable historical and
scientific information, as assets for economic and social development, and as integral parts of a people's
cultural identity and practices. The loss of such resources is irreversible, but fortunately, it is often
avoidable.
Indigenous People (OP/BP 4.10): The main objectives of the Indigenous People Policy are to: (i) ensure
that indigenous people affected by World Bank funded projects have a voice in project design and
implementation; (ii) ensure that adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples are avoided, minimized or
mitigated; and (iii) ensure that benefits intended for indigenous peoples are culturally appropriate. This
policy underscores the need for Borrowers and Bank staff to identify indigenous peoples, consult with
them, ensure that they participate in, and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally
appropriate way - and that adverse impacts on them are avoided, or where not feasible, minimized or
mitigated.
Pest Management (OP 4.09): Rural development and health sector projects have to avoid using harmful
pesticides. A preferred solution is to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques and encourage
their use in the whole of the sectors concerned. In appraising a project that will involve pest
management, the Bank assesses the capacity of the country's regulatory framework and institutions to
promote and support safe, effective, and environmentally sound pest management and uses various
XLVI

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

means to assess pest management in the country and support integrated pest management (IPM) and
the safe use of agricultural pesticides.
Projects on International Waterway (OP 7.50): The objective of the policy is to ensure that the
international aspects of a project on an international waterway are dealt with at the earliest possible
opportunity and that riparian's are notified of the proposed project and its details. It may affect the
relations between the World Bank and its borrowers, and between riparian states. Therefore, the Bank
attaches great importance to the riparian making appropriate agreements or arrangements for the
entire waterway, or parts thereof, and stands ready to assist in this regard.
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60): The objective of the policy is to ensure that other claimants to the
disputed area have no objection to the project, or that the special circumstances of the case warrant the
Bank’s support of the project notwithstanding any objection or lack of approval by the other claimants.
Project may affect the relations between the Bank and its borrowers, and between the claimants to the
disputed area. Therefore, the Bank will only finance projects in disputed areas when either there is no
objection from the other claimant to the disputed area, or when the special circumstances of the case
support Bank financing, notwithstanding the objection.
Safety Dams (OP.4.37): The policy objective is to ensure quality and safety in the design and
construction of new dams and the rehabilitation of existing dams, and in carrying out activities that may
be affected by an existing dam. When the WB finance new dams, this policy requires that experienced
and competent professionals design and supervise construction and that the borrower adopts and
implements dam safety measures through the pr project cycle.

Major Environmental and Social Implications

Detailed design of the DHM system Program

i) Most of the field level staffs (working staffs) especially
women and marginalized individuals (station observers) are
not familiar with department's activities (sometimes isolate
from the department). In this situation, likelihood of excluding
in consultation with those persons while designing of future
DHM system.

Capacity Building

ii) The local vulnerable communities (socially, economically
disadvantaged groups) are hardly aware about the services of
the department. In this condition, social implication due to
lack of knowledge about the department's services. The voices
of those communities about the DHM's services are hardly
included in the new system of the department.
i) Likelihood of less participation of field level staffs-Women,
isolated persons in capacity building trainings.
ii) Probability of less participation of powerless and
marginalized people in on-the job-training
iii) Vulnerable groups especially women are likely to be
isolated from advanced computer training
iii) Probability of brain drains

DHM Institutional development and networks i)Likelihood of unbalancing of roles and responsibilities of
restructuring options
women and men and controlling resources at field level
ii) Due to a several limitations in the government
administrative system, it may cause a less priority for the
active consultations at all levels( from central to field level)
and at concerned stakeholders as well. As a result, probability
of weak chance of addressing gender equality (equal rights,
opportunities, and responsibilities of women and men) in
developing operational guidelines and strategic road map of
the department.
Development of a Legal and Regularity i) Likely exclusion of small and marginalized farmers through

E-wastes and backup power system (including batteries) may
contain various types of hazardous substances including
mercury, lead, sulfuric acid, nickel, cadmium etc. This poses a
potential threat to human health and the environment when
improperly disposed. These chemical may leach into the land
and water, as well as to wildlife and human.
ii) Gauge-house with its fencing for AHS requires about 60 sq

might be barren or forest coverage.
Likelihood of impacts of lands-private and public. But the lands
to be acquired for AWS/AHS would not cause resettlement.

iii) Mobile calibration facilities could not occupy lands for a
long-time. So it does not show any adverse impacts.

iv) The radar dish or antenna transmits pulses of radio waves
or microwaves-electromagnetic radiation which bounce off
any object in their path to detect the range, speed, and other
characteristics of remote objects (weather parameters).
Microwave has not been shown finally that microwaves have
significant adverse biological effects at low levels.

During the stakeholder consultation at district level, local
people, leaders, planners, security forces etc are willing to
guarantee that there are no any adverse impacts due to the
microwaves emitted from Radar. Regarding the implication of
Radar-a detailed technical survey with EIA needs to be carried
out.

vi) Likelihood of adverse impacts due to waste electrical,
electronic (e-waste), and metallic equipments. Informal
processing of such wastes is in practice may cause health and
pollution problems. So, a great care must be taken to avoid
unsafe exposure in recycling operations.

Annex 5.1: A brief process for EIA/IEE and some Templates
The assessment process will constitute a systematic approach to the evaluation of a project in the
context of the natural, regulatory and environment of the area in which development is proposed as
illustrated in following Figure.

Figure 5.2: Environmental and Social Assessment Process

LVI

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

Quality Assurance
Soon after the commencement of planning and design process, based on desk study, reconnaissance
survey and experience of earlier projects, detailed methodology and schedule should be prepared for
the effective and timely execution of the Environmental and Social Assessment.
Scoping
Scoping is required for screening. The next step in the Environmental and Social Assessment Process will
be to define the proposed project activities and the natural, legal and environment of the area in which
development will occur. This will be achieved through Scoping. Scoping will identifies which of the
activities has a potential to interact with the environment. Scoping will be conducted early in the
Environmental and Social Assessment Process so that a focus on the priority issues can be established
for the rest of the Environmental and Social Assessment Process.
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
Based on the screening results, assembled legislative requirements, engineering, environmental and
socio-economic data will be assessed in greater detail to ensure that all of the proposed activities and
their consequences/likely impacts are considered in full. In order to identify any potential impact on and
potential change to the natural and socioeconomic environments, the environmental and social baseline
is necessary to be collected. For true effects prediction the following key questionnaire will be
attempted to answer:





How will a particular project activity give rise to an impact?
How likely is it that an impact will occur?
What will be the consequence of each impact?
What will be the spatial and temporal extent of each impact?

Environmental hazard and risk assessment
Environmental Hazard and Risk Management EHRM is critical so that selection of any alternative is done
taking care of all the components. EHRA workshops will be held to identify the potential environmental
hazards associated with each proposed activity/alternative having participants comprise of key
personnel’s from DHM, AMIS of DOA and World Bank team. Workshop will take input from all workshop
participants in the identification of potential environmental hazards associated with the project
activities and the evaluation of possible alternatives and options. Further, each will used to confirm the
impact assessment team understands of the project design and as an opportunity to gather additional
information on the project where necessary. All hazards identified will be addressed and mitigation
measures will be proposed to counter any adverse impact.
Environmental impacts identification
Based on base line data collected along with engineering and social inputs, a comprehensive study will
be taken to identify the possible impact on environmental attributes. The impacts will be defined in
terms of their temporal and spatial implication. Once all project environmental and social aspects will be
identified, the level of impact that may result from each of the activity-receptor interactions will be
assessed. In assessing the level of impact that an activity may cause, two key elements are considered
LVII

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

namely consequence and likelihood. Prioritization of the projects should be done with respect to
positive and negative environmental implications of the project and socio-economic benefits of each
alternative and finally project having minimum adverse impacts with highest benefits should be
selected.
Mitigation and Monitoring Plan
Mitigation is an integral part of impact evaluation. It looks for better ways of doing things so that the
negative impacts of the proposal are eliminated or minimized and the benefits are enhanced. As soon as
significant adverse impacts are identified, discussions should be held to see if they can be ‘designed out’
through changes in project design, location or operation.
Identified severe in consequence category and or likelihood category will be further analyzed to identify
additional mitigation measures that are potentially available to eliminate or reduce the predicted level
of impact. Where mitigation is deemed appropriate, a proponent should strive to act upon effects, in
the following order of priority, to:





Eliminate or avoid adverse effects, where reasonably achievable.
Reduce adverse effects to the lowest reasonably achievable level.
Regulate adverse effects to an acceptable level, or to an acceptable time period.
Create other beneficial effects to partially or fully substitute for, or counter-balance, adverse
effects.

Environmental Management Plan
EMP consists of the set of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures to be taken during
implementation and operation to eliminate adverse environmental and social impacts, offset them, or
reduce them to acceptable levels. The EMP identifies feasible and cost-effective measures that may
reduce potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels. The plan includes
compensatory measures if mitigation measures are not feasible, cost-effective, or sufficient.The EMP
should be developed so as to counter the impacts assessed during screening process and also the likely
impacts during the construction and operational phase. For the case of High and Moderate impact level
plan will be developed in EIA and IEE.
The subprojects that are not under the IEE or EIA threshold but if their implementation could have
adverse environmental and social impacts; they fall under Low or negligible category. The
environmental social management of subprojects and their selection criteria will ensure that any
selected subproject does not adversely affect people particularly the vulnerable and poor and their
environment. Meanwhile it may be difficult to assign a value to measure the social harm done by a
subproject. In such situation one may have to use his cautious judgment to weigh up the magnitude of
damage or loss instead of banking on entirely on the prescribed criteria. In this scenario Project
management unit will prepare a general plan following the Environmental Standards, and fill

Potential Impact of Project Activities as presented in Annex 5.2 . Project Management Unit (PMU)

LVIII

Annex for Environmental and Social Management Framework for Implementation of Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards

will also fill Project Impacts and recommended Mitigation Measures as presented in the Annex 5.3 to
know about the mitigation cost.
Department of Hydrology and Meteorology will be the executing Agency executing agency of the
BRCRH. On a day to day basis, implementation will be coordinated by a PMU of DHM. The PMU will play
a coordinating and facilitating role to all components to implement environment safeguard measures
spell out in the ESMF. Environment and social specialist are recommended in a PMU support team. Their
role is to review all the documents prior to sending for approval. The PMU will have overall
responsibility to ensure that subproject are in compliance with framework and follow all policy
principles and procedures to address environmental issues as lay down in the framework.
