100% of the target for the training of lead and assistant trainers (DLI 1) were met.



Eighty four percent of the FY 2011/12 target for the training of skills test assessors (DLI 3) and 72%
of the target for the training of skills test managers (DLI 4) were met. These results were achieved in
a period of five months, compensating for the delay in project start-up.



Scholarship candidates from Technical School Leaving Certificate (TSLC) programs have received
100% of the payment for FY 2011/12.



A total of 87 firms have been shortlisted to provide results-based short-term training to 7,500
beneficiaries. The evaluation of their technical and financial proposals is nearing completion.



A total of 4,132 candidates (103% of the annual target in the Results Framework) were tested for the
Recognition of Prior Learning.



Arrangements have been made for third party verification of the DLI outputs 1-4 through the Citizen
Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program.



The verification of DLI outputs 1-4 will be done jointly by the PS and IDA as an exception for FY
2011/12 and will be completed by September 31, 2012.



The Financial Management Information System (FMIS) is fully operational. The programs are almost
ready for the project Management Information System (MIS) but the software for the server is yet to
arrive.



The Implementation Progress Report (IPR), including the Financial Management Report (FMR), for
the second trimester (FY 2011/12) was submitted on time and has been approved.

IV.

Component-wise Implementation Progress, Issues and Recommendations

6. Project Development Objective: The Project Development Objective is to expand the supply of skilled
and employable labor by increasing access to quality training programs, and by strengthening the
technical and vocational education and training system in Nepal.
7. The project consists of the following four components: (1) Strengthening TEVT Regulatory Activities
and Capacity Building; (2) Strengthening Technical Education; (3) Support for Short-Term Training
and Recognition of Prior Learning; and (4) Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.
Component 1: Strengthening TEVT Regulatory Activities and Capacity Building
8. This component focuses on the regulatory environment and institutional resources available to the
TEVT sector to draw upon for current functioning and future development. Disbursements under this
component are results-based and linked to specific outputs and milestones for each activity supported.
9. In spite of a delay in project start-up, very good progress has been made towards the achievement of
targets for DLIs 1-4. As summarized in Table 1, the FY 2011/122 target for the training of master
trainers (DLI 2) has been exceeded by 60%; and 100% of the target for the training of lead and
assistant trainers (DLI 1) has been met. Although the targets for the remaining two DLIs have not
been fully met, the progress should be considered satisfactory considering that the MoU between the
PS and NSTB for the achievement of DLIs 3 and 4 was signed only five months ago3.

2

The DLI achievements are for FY2011/12 for reimbursement after verification in FY2012/13.
The MoU between the EVENT PS and NSTB for the training of skills test assessors (DLI 3) and managers (DLI 4)
was signed on February 26, 2012. Similarly, the MoU between the EVENT PS and TITI for the training of master
trainers and lead/assistant trainers was signed on January 19, 2012. The training for all four categories of trainees
was conducted by TITI.

10. During the course of the consultations, the joint review team held discussions with groups of lead and
assistant trainers, master trainers, skills test assessors and skills test managers trained by TITI as part
of the EVENT project. The training graduates were unanimous in their view that the training was of
high quality in terms of management, content and delivery.
11. The PS has met the minimum targets for DLIs 1-4 for the year 2011-12. Reimbursements for the
achievement of DLI targets 1-4 will be made by IDA after the PS submits its achievement report and
IDA independently verifies the outputs. Because of a delay in the selection of an appropriate
organization to carry out the third party verification, it has been agreed that the verification of outputs
for DLIs 1-4 for FY 2011/12 will be done jointly by IDA and the PS ‘as an exception.’ Starting FY
2012/13, the verification will be done by a third party. Arrangements have been made for third party
verification of these DLI outputs through the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and
Accountability (CARTA) Program. The joint verification of outputs for FY 2011/12 will be
completed by September 31, 2012.
12. For each fiscal year, IDA disbursements will be made independently for each DLI according to the
outputs achieved. For each DLI, a minimum of 50% of the annual target must be achieved for any
disbursement to be made for that year. However, if the achievement is below 50%, the outputs from
the following year(s) can be used to make up for the shortfall.
13. The preparation of the MoU between the PS and CTEVT for strengthening the CTEVT affiliation
system (DLI 5), strengthening the CTEVT examination system (DLI 6) and scaling up the Training
Management Information System or the CTEVT TMIS (DLI 7) has been delayed, and now is
undergoing revision to be signed and made operational in this fiscal year. It has been agreed that the
MoU will be submitted by the PS to IDA for review and clearance by August 15, 2012, and the MoU
will be signed between the two parties by September 30, 2012. The plan for developing/revising 20
TSLC and Diploma level courses may be included as part of the same MoU.
14. For the next cycle of DLIs 1-4 for FY 2012/13, it has been agreed that the PS will submit the MoUs
that need to be signed between the PS, CTEVT and TITI for DLIs 1-2, and the PS, CTEVT and
NSTB for DLIs 3-4, to IDA for review and clearance by August 12, 2012, and complete the signature
process by August 25, 2012. IDA strongly recommends that the time-line agreed to be adhered to so
that the momentum gained in the achievement of these DLI outputs is maintained, and there are no
gaps in the transition from the first cycle to the next.
Component 2: Strengthening Technical Education
15. This component focuses on strengthening technical education at the Technical School Leaving
Certificate (TSLC) and Diploma levels provided by CTEVT constituent and affiliated institutions,
4

and Community School Annex Programs (CSAPs) by providing Matching Grants 4, and Performance
Grants5 on a competitive basis6 (see Annex 4 for details).
16. Matching Grant: IDA has cleared guidelines for the selection of TSLC and Diploma training
institutions, including the distribution mechanisms of these grants to institutions, subject to the PS
incorporating comments provided. LOI for matching grants for the first round has been published and
the last date for receiving applications is August 4, 2012. Short-listing of eligible institutions for the
first round is expected to be completed by August 18, 2012. Call for LOIs for matching grants for the
second round will be published by August 31, 2012. Between October 15 and November 1, 2012,
selection of institutions from both rounds of calls for proposals will be completed. Performance
Grant: The PS has shared an initial draft of guidelines for selection of private TSLC and Diploma
training institutions for performance grants. Institutions selected for support under matching grants
are automatically eligible to receive funds under performance grants. The PS still needs to finalize the
mechanism for distributing performance grants to the selected institutions. During the consultations,
11 performance indicators under 3 different categories were agreed upon: (i) quality and efficiency –
4 indicators: (ii) equity – 3 indicators; and (iii) expansion and innovation – 4 indicators (see Annex
4). Indicators and formulae for computing performance grant amounts for supported institutions will
be piloted and finalized by August 15, 2012. It was agreed that the PS will share the updated draft of
the guidelines with IDA for review and clearance by August 31, 2012, and publish call for proposals
from private affiliated institutions by September 15, 2012.
17. CTEVT affiliated eligible community technical institutions can also compete for matching and
performance grants but the criteria for defining these institutions need to be clarified. During the
consultations, criteria developed by CTEVT for the purpose were discussed. It was agreed that these
criteria would be finalized after further discussion, that the final criteria should not conflict with those
GON has already developed for community higher education institutions for public funding.
18. Scholarships for TSLC and Diploma students (FY 2011/2012): Of the targeted 1,104 scholarship
recipients for the FY 2011/12, 904 (730 TSLC and 174 Diploma) were selected and have received the
first and second installments (through Rashtriya Banijya Bank Limited).
19. Scholarships for TSLC and Diploma students (FY 2012/13): The Proxy Means Targeting (PMT)
mechanism is being used to select this cohort of students. Tasks have been divided amongst the PS
and SFAFDB through an MoU: the PS is responsible for information outreach and media campaign
throughout the country and SFAFDB is mandated for timely distribution and collection of filled PMT
forms from applicants, data entry and category-wise short-listing of applicants. The final selection
will be done by the PS itself. Due to delays in signing the MoU and extension of the application
submission deadline, selection of beneficiaries could not be completed before the students took
CTEVT entrance exams as agreed earlier (to generate the largest pool of applicants for the
scholarships as possible). Important tasks that still remain to be carried out before final selection are:
a. verifying from the applicant database whether or not applicants have passed the CTEVT entrance
exams; and b. field verification of information for at least 10% of applications. It was agreed that the
PS will publish the list of scholarship recipients for FY2012/13 by October 30, 2012, and sign the
participation agreements with selected candidates by December 15, 2012.

4

Three types of technical institutes eligible for Matching Grant: (i) CTEVT Constituent Institutes; (ii) CTEVT affiliated Community Institutes;
and (iii) Community School Annex Programs.
5
Four types of technical institutes eligible for Performance Grant: (i) three types of institutes eligible for MG; and (ii) CTEVT affiliated Private
Institutes.
6
Each type of institutions will compete among themselves to qualify for the grants.

Component 3: Supporting Short-Term Vocational Training and Recognition of Prior Learning
20. This component supports short term vocational training and the certification of technical and
vocational skills acquired through informal means.
Short-term Training
21. The project targets for short-term training for FY 2012/13 under the voucher-based and results-based
financing modalities were 1,000 and 7,500 beneficiaries, respectively. While short-term training has
not yet been launched, letters of intent (LOIs) from potential training providers have been received
and evaluated by the PS for both modalities.
22. In the case of results-based short-term training, 87 firms were shortlisted from a pool of 170 that
submitted LOIs, and were asked to submit their technical and financial proposals to the PS. Among
the 170 applicants, training providers that met the project’s eligibility criteria (95 in total) were given
Rapid Market Appraisal (RMA) training before the short-listing was done. The RMA training was
conducted jointly by the PS and the Employment Fund (EF), utilizing the latter’s expertise and
experience in RMA training. The evaluation of the technical and financial proposals for the 87 firms
is nearing completion. These firms will be contracted to train a total of 7,500 beneficiaries during
FY2012/13 for meeting the target from the previous year.
23. The PS has proposed a target of 11,000 beneficiaries for FY2012/13. It therefore plans to publish
another call for LOIs for results-based short-term training after the launch of the first round.
24. As there will be over 900 short-term training events during FY 2012/13 alone, and each training event
requires 4-5 monitoring visits7, a comprehensive and effective M & E system for short-term training
must be in place before any short-term training is launched. In order to set up such a system in a
timely manner, the PS has proposed a joint monitoring mechanism with EF whereby their existent
extensive regional monitoring infrastructure, experience, and expertise can be utilized to effectively
monitor short-term training under EVENT without any significant cost. The PS can also make use of
resources of the MoE at the central, regional and local levels in the process The PIC will make a
decision on the setting up of an appropriate M & E system by August 10, 2012. IDA will provide its
no-objection for carrying out short-term training activities under this component once a sound M & E
system is in place.
25. One issue raised by CTEVT and the PS during the consultations was the need to allow CTEVT
constituent schools to provide short-term training under the project. It has been agreed that IDA and
the PS will further discuss how this can be accomplished.
Recognition of Prior Learning
26. Altogether 4,132 youth from 72 districts were tested for recognition of prior learning (RPL) in 38
centers across the nation. The certification process is on-going and is expected to be completed by
September 2012. The advertisement for the next round of RPL will be published by November 15,
2012.

7

As each training event has an average class size of 20, there will be approximately 925 training events (18500
beneficiaries/20 beneficiaries per event) during FY 2013/14.

6

Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
Project Management:
27. The PS will finalize the Terms of Reference (TORs) and complete the hiring of the technical team
consisting of individual consultants – procurement, Financial Management (FM) and M & E by
September 2012. The PS has hired one media expert for developing communications strategies for the
project. Given the increasing need for enhanced outreach, the TORs for this position need to be
reviewed to cover a wider mandate.
28. Finalization of Project Implementation Manual: As also suggested during the last consultations, the
PS will prepare two simplified guidelines in Nepali targeted towards the beneficiaries – one for
scholarships or stipends and the other for users of Category 1 activities8. The work is already in
progress and the PS aims to complete these by September 15, 2012.
29. Project website9: The PS has been advised to regularly update the project website and to upload all
project documents including the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Project Implementation Manual
(PIM), the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), guidelines prepared for
various activities, advertisements for applications, aide-memoires etc. As much as possible, Nepali
versions of the documents should also be prepared and uploaded.
30. Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E): The second trimester Implementation Progress Report
[November 2011-March, 2012] has been submitted by the PS to IDA. It has been reviewed and
approved by IDA. An update on the Results Agreement is provided in Annex 2.
Component-wise Progress of the M & E System
31. Component 1: The monitoring forms and manuals for DLIs 1-4 have been developed. The monitoring
tools and system for the remaining 3 DLIs will be developed after the MoU with CTEVT has been
signed. Third party monitoring and verification of the outputs for DLIs 1-4 will be done by the
Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) Program. The joint
verification of outputs for FY 2011/12 will be completed by September 31, 2012
32. Component 2: The PS is working on the monitoring tools, their manual and guidelines for this
component. For PMT based scholarship to TSLC and Diploma students, the M & E tools for all
stages of student selection processes (information dissemination, forms distribution and collection,
data-entry, field verification, stipend distribution and student enrollment and attendance) have been
finalized. While many of these forms could not be used this year as activities were already completed
by the time the forms were developed, they will be used for the next round of student selection for
scholarship support. Baseline data from institutions will be collected once they have signed the
participation agreements (contracts/MoUs) with the PS.
33. Component 3: While the tools for monitoring both short-term training and RPL activities have been
developed, an appropriate M & E system for short-term training is not yet in place. As the training
will take place across many districts, the PS needs to quickly decide how to establish such a
mechanism so as not to delay the launch of this activity. Baseline data from institutions will be
collected once they have signed the participation agreements (contracts/MoUs) with the PS.

“Category” means a category set forth in the table in Section IV of Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement for the
EVENT project between GON and IDA.

7

34. Component 4: A formal MoU has been signed between the Employment Fund (EF)10 and EVENT to
share knowledge and experience. Through this MoU, EF has provided pro-bono technical support to
EVENT in the area of short-term training including conducting Rapid Market Appraisal training. The
Project has also taken the EF electronic management information system (MIS) and adapted and
expanded it to develop a comprehensive Project MIS for EVENT.
35. Programs for the MIS have been written but the server is not yet ready. The MIS consultant has
completed developing formats for DLIs 1-4 under component one, all stages of the student selection
processes (information dissemination, form distribution and collection, data-entry, field verification,
stipend distribution and student enrollment and attendance) under component 2, and short-term
training and certification of prior learning. A system of evaluation based on the monitoring tools and
information fed in by end users received at the PS is being finalized.
V.

Procurement

36. Project procurement planning and implementation status of the approved procurement plan has been
satisfactory. Project procurement includes procurement of goods, services and non-consulting
services. With regard to the implementation of the approved procurement plan, procurement of the
activities under goods has met their target within the schedule or with some delay. Progress under the
procurement of consulting and non-consulting services is only around 70%. The PS shared that the
main reason for this was the delay in signing the MoU between the PS and CTEVT and between the
PS and the Department of Labor. Short-term training is provided in both CTEVT constituent public
and affiliated private training institutions. During the meetings, it has been agreed that the PS and
IDA will have discussions on how CTEVT constituent schools can participate in the provision of
short-term training under the project. It was also agreed that building on the experience gained by the
Project and other agencies in conducting similar trainings, an appropriate method for selecting
training providers will be worked out and based on all this an updated procurement plan for FY
2012/13 will be prepared and submitted to IDA by the end of August, 2012.
VI.

Financial Management and Disbursement

37. Budget for FY2011/12 and Estimated Expenditures: The budget for EVENT is allocated under
the budget head 3,501,353 (Recurrent) and 3,501,354 (Capital). Total budget of NRs.596.80 million
(eqv. USD 7.20 million) has been allocated under Recurrent (NRs.479.70 million) and Capital
(NRs.117.10 million). The review team noted that all anomalies in the budget as noted during the
last review have now been corrected. Total estimated expenditures for FY2011/12 are only
NRs.120.67 million, which is only about 20.2% of the approved budget. Of this, total recurrent
expenditures were NRs.105.61 million or 22% o the approved Recurrent Budget and total capital
expenditures were NRs.15.06 million or 12.9% of the approved Capital Budget. This indicates that
the implementation during FY2011/12 was very slow.
38. Retroactive Financing. There is a retroactive financing provision in the legal agreement for
expenditures incurred on or after May 16, 2011 under Categories 3 and 4. The review team
confirmed that there are no retroactive financing incurred.
39. Budget for FY2012/13. Due to political situation affected by the dissolution of the Constituent
Assembly, the government was not able to announce the annual work program and full budget for
10

The Employment Fund , which has extensive experience in short-term training, is guided by a steering committee
chaired by the Joint Secretary of Planning at MoE. It also implements the IDA-funded Adolescent Girls
Employment Initiative (AGEI) project.

8

FY2012/13. According to the decision of the government, only one third of previous year’s
expenditures have been approved to be programmed for the first trimester. EVENT is preparing the
work program and budget based on this decision. No major development expenditures will incur
during the first trimester. The review team suggested to include the committed program and related
expenditures in the work program and provide with appropriate justification if this exceeds the
ceiling based one one-third expenditures of the previous fiscal year.
40. Disbursements. Total disbursement as of July 28, 2012 is USD 6.79 million drawn from IDA Grant
as the initial deposit to the Designated Accounts. The Project has not drawn any funds from the
categories. Key reasons for no disbursements are slow start up of the Project and delay in compliance
with disbursement conditions. The second trimester Implementation Progress Report which includes
Financial Monitoring Report has recently been approved, and it has not called for any documentation
of expenditures nor required any further advance to the Designated Account. The review team noted
that there has been some progress in the achievement of DLI 1 to 4, and upon independent
verification and certification of the outputs achieved, some disbursement is expected under Category
1.
41. Disbursement Condition. There is a disbursement condition that relates to Category 1 and 2.
Preparation of the Project Implementation Manual acceptable to IDA and adoption of the Manual is
the disbursement condition in order to implement activities and disbursements incurred under these
two categories. The disbursement condition for Category 2 was lifted in March 2012. Somehow
lifting the disbursement condition for Category 1 was missed during this time, which was noted
during this review. During the review period, IDA lifted the disbursement condition for Category 1.
42. Financial Management Action Plan. The review team reviewed the implementation of FM Action
Plan as agreed during negotiations. Due to delay in project start up, there has been a slippage in a few
actions. The review team discussed and agreed new time line for these actions, which are as follows:
a. Finance Staff. There is an agreement that one Finance Officer and one Accountant would be put
in place in the Project Secretariat by May 30, 2011. The Accountant is already in place, and the
position of Finance Officer has been created. However, the Finance Officer position has yet to be
filled. If there is a further delay in getting the Finance Officer in place, the Project agreed to use
a temporary staff for this work, and also recruit a short-term consultant to provide support to the
Project. In addition to provide financial management support to the project, the consultant will
also play a key role in monitoring the financial management status of the beneficiaries of the
Project. The Project agreed to share the terms of reference of the consultant with IDA for
comments. The Project aimed to have the consultant on board by September 2012. The review
team reminded the government the clause under Schedule 2, para 2 (d) of the Financing
Agreement which specifies that critical staff will not be transferred until the completion of the
Project.
b. Computerized Financial Management Information System (FMIS). The review team noted that
the FMIS is now operational. The whole financial transaction is now entered in the FMIS and all
reports are generated through the system.
43. Financial Management. The project team has made good efforts in maintaining books of accounts
as required by the government system. The review team noted that the books of accounts are all upto-date. The Project has now begun to deface the invoices with the PAID stamp after the payments
are made. Internal audit has not taken place.

9

44. Implementation Progress Report: There are no outstanding implementation progress reports. The
second trimester report for FY2011/12 has been received and approved. No progress is observed
from the financial report of the second trimester. It did not warrant for any documentation or for any
further advance. The review team reminded that the third trimester report of FY2011/12 is due on
August 31, 2012.
45. Audit Report: The first unaudited report that will be required is for FY2011/12 which is due on
October 15, 2012. The review team also reminded that the first audited report is for FY2011/12
which is due on January 15, 2013.
VII.

Environmental Management and Social Safeguards

46. Environmental Management: The PS has prepared Matching Grant operational Guidelines,
Performance Grant Operational Guidelines and Short-Term Training Guidelines. These Guidelines,
inter alia, also contain environmental provisions. It was agreed that Chapter 3 of the ESMF will be
provided as an annex in these guidelines. During the previous consultations, it was agreed that the
trimester Implementation Progress Report (IPR) of the project will contain information regarding
environmental safeguard activities. As of now, no subproject proposals for civil works have been
received by the PS.
47. There have been delays in the following actions from the previous consultations for which new
completion dates have been agreed: a) While the ESMF has been finalized it is yet to be translated
into Nepali. It was agreed that the final English version of the ESMF will be uploaded on the project
website and disseminated to potential partner institutions immediately; ESMF will be translated into
Nepali by August 31, 2012, and disseminated by September 2012; b) during the orientation workshop
for partner institutions, the ESMF provisions and requirements were not covered. It was agreed that in
all forthcoming orientations, there will be one dedicated session on the ESMF; and c) although the
IPR reports on environmental safeguards status, supervision report does not. It was agreed that
supervision report now onward also cover environmental status.
48. During the consultations, the six-monthly environmental management status report to be prepared by
the PS and the annual independent environmental compliance check were discussed. It was agreed
that the PS will complete the necessary preparatory work for commissioning the latter soon.
Considering the lack of environmental expertise within the PS, it was agreed that the PS will maintain
a roster of qualified environmental specialists for obtaining their short-term services as and when
required. As during the previous consultations, the IDA team reiterated their advice to the PS to
coordinate with the Department of Education’s environmental engineer on matters related to
environmental management in EVENT.
49. Social Safeguards: IDA has noted satisfactory progress made by the PS relating to social issues. In
the previous year, the Proxy Means Test (PMT) method could not be used to select candidates for
scholarships but an agreement has now been signed with SFAFDB to take this process forward.
During the FY 2068/69, there were 904 TSLC/Diploma scholarships that were granted. Out of these,
445 recipients (49.2 percent) were girls. The PS has not yet analyzed the information on scholarship
recipients along other dimensions of disadvantages such as caste/ethnicity, disability status, lagging
regions, etc. It has been agreed that the PS will avail the disaggregated information to the IDA team
by end-August 2012.
50. The IDA team also reviewed the ‘Matching Grant Operational Guide’ prepared for FY 2012/13, and
has noted that incentive schemes for the vulnerable groups have been incorporated in accordance with
the specifications contained in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for
10

the project. The team is also pleased to note that the media strategy developed for the project contains
specific measures for targeting vulnerable groups in order to ensure that they are knowledgeable and
aware of the scholarship schemes.
51. In terms of safeguards, the review team noted a few inconsistencies in the EMSF, PIM and PAD, that
needs to be corrected before the final version of the ESMF is publicized in the project website,
translated and disseminated. These include different information on the age limits of the trainees,
installments for short-term training, and information on land acquisition. The PS has agreed to make
these changes immediately.
52. The PIM also includes provisions for social screening of potential projects prior to inviting full subproject proposals. The PS has not yet developed a checklist or a template for social screening. The
IDA team has recommended, and the PS has agreed that a checklist for social screening that is akin to
the Environmental Screening Checklist will be developed by end-August 2012.
53. Monitoring and Reporting: The PS has agreed that the MIS for the project will incorporate
disaggregated information along the various dimensions of vulnerability that the project seeks to
address (e.g., gender, caste, ethnicity, lagging regions, etc.).
54. The IPR and supervision related reviews for the project do not report on the implementation of social
and environmental management issues on a regular basis. The PS has agreed to incorporate them
from now onwards even if there are no major issues to be reported.
55. Finally, the IDA team has noted that a Grievance Redress Mechanism provisioned for in the ESMF
has not yet been institutionalized effectively. The project website includes provisions for ‘feedback’
and other types of complaints are handled by project officials as and when people come to the project
office to complain. The PS has agreed to formalize the GRM by putting up a ‘Suggestion Box’ in the
project office, starting a Complaint Register, and designating a staff to handle complaints/grievances
by end-August 2012.
VIII.

Governance

56. The Coordination Committee (CC), Project Implementation Committee (PIC), Technical Advisory
Committee (TAC) and PS have been constituted as per agreement. Clear terms of reference for the
CC, PIC, TAC and all PS staff have been prepared and have received clearance from IDA. CTEVT is
represented in the CC and PIC, and leads the TAC. The CC which is not a project specific entity but
responsible for all vocational activities across the Government has yet to meet. There has been
considerable delay in the passage of NSTB, one of the key implementation partners of EVENT, byelaws (original agreed date April 21, 2011) with implications for the project’s agreed action on
granting greater autonomy to NSTB. Apart from the project action, the recently adopted TEVT policy
of the Government foresees more autonomy to NSTB. This needs therefore to be expedited. The
CTEVT has agreed to pass the bye-laws by September 30, 2012.
57. The project must have a strong monitoring system. Among other things, the Project should engage
third-party monitors in verifying selected project activities, to assess the correctness of information
submitted by individual beneficiaries and supported training providers. CARTA has been contracted
to carry out independent monitoring services for DLI 1-4 outputs, which is encouraging. With the
start of selecting short-term training providers from the private sector who will be conducting more
than 900 training events across more than 20 districts, the project’s monitoring capacity needs to
enhance significantly, especially at the local level. Among options available to the PS, is the
possibility of engaging the Employment Fund to monitor project activities. The EF has technical
11

expertise and experience in the area of short-term vocational training and is already present in all five
development regions and working with them could be more efficient and cost-effective than adding
staff to the PS. Each short-term training event needs to be monitored at different stages from the
selection and enrollment of trainees, delivery of training, testing and certification of trainees and their
job placement. From a governance and accountability perspective short-term training should not be
launched before a sound M & E system is in place.
58. The project is committed to developing and publishing service standards for contract management,
scholarship process and inter-agency coordination so that the quality of delivery could be assessed
against these standards. Work in this area, however, has not started yet. The project’s grievance
handling system needs to be managed more systematically. This has been an ad hoc exercise so far.
For example, the project received some complaints on scholarship and PMT; they have been resolved
through dialogue with complainants. Going forward, two steps would be important. First, a system
should be in place to handle grievances with mechanisms to track progress. Second, information on
the system should be disseminated widely so that people know how to approach project authorities in
case they are not happy about any aspect of the project. As an immediate improvement, EVENT
website could offer some space for grievances, with a tracking system in place.
59. GAAP Implementation: Most GAAP actions are in progress, although they were delayed. The Project
itself took some time to take off, which explains why many GAAP actions missed their original
deadline. As part of the review, an updated GAAP (Annex 6) has been agreed with project
participants.

ANNEX 4
Preliminary Criteria and Process for payment of Matching Grants (MG)
and Performance Grants (PG)
Matching Grants (MG)
1.
Three types of technical institutes are eligible for MG: (i) CTEVT Constituent Institutes; (ii)
CTEVT affiliated Community Institutes; and (iii) Community School Annex Programs (CSAP).
Participating institutions selected following due process12 will receive the MG in installments upon
completion of and duly endorsed by the duly formed governing bodies the Institutional Plan/Strategic
Plan (SP) of respective institutions.
2.
Participating institutions will receive MG in installments: (i) As an incentive grant, institutions
will receive 1st installment (10% of the Annual Work Plan and Budget of the fiscal year) upon receiving
the institutions commitment of 5% and a credible funding plan for the tasks envisioned under the MG.
Subsequent, installments will be released upon approval13 of the claims submitted by respective
institutions against completed tasks defined in the AWPB.
Performance Grants (PG)
3.
Four types of technical institutes are eligible for PG: the three types of above stated institutes
eligible for MG and CTEVT affiliated Private Institutes. The Consultations agreed on 11 performance
indicators (see Table below) under 3 different categories: (i) quality and efficiency - 4 indicators; (ii)
equity – 3 indicators; and (iii) expansion and innovation – 4 indicators.
4.
To consider the scale/size of the CSAPs, which are smaller compared to CTEVT Constituent and
Affiliated Institutions and also to further promote the community contribution envisioned by the
government in the design of CSAPs, unit rate of items for CSAPs in Table 1 is double the amount for
CTEVT Constituent and Affiliated Institutions. Similarly, to consider the characteristics of CTEVT
Private Institutes compared to Constituent and Community ones, four performance indicators14 were
agreed not to be applicable for private institutions.
5.
Consideration of lagging Regions. The grant in Table 1 below will be multiplied by a Human
Development Index (HDI) Factor (HDIF) of the district the participating institutions. HDIF = (National
average HDI)/ (HDI of the District of the participating institution) but should not be less than 1 and more
than 1.5. For practical purposes HDIF (standardized) will be used from Table 2 below.

12

The process has been defined in the Implementation Guidelines.
PS approved 1st five claims will be prior-reviewed by the Bank; other claims/installments will be post reviewed following Bank’s procurement
procedures.
14
The four performance indicators CTEVT affiliated private institutions will not receive PG are: (i) New Program in TSLC; (ii) New program in
Diploma; (iii) New innovative program in TSLC; (iv) New innovative program in Diploma.

ANNEX 5

Summary of Discussions with Project Beneficiaries
A. Scholarship Recipients
The interaction focused on notification of scholarship opportunity, selection process, notification of
scholarship recipients, registration and verification process of scholarship recipients, opening of bank
account of each recipient, dispatch money in each students account, conditions for scholarship, use of
scholarship, and students’ feelings and reactions on scholarship.
Key Findings







Students received information about the availability of scholarships mostly through their schools and
also from newspapers and friends and relatives.
After notification students opened bank account in Rastriya Banijya Bank, signed the Scholarship
Bond Paper (most of them signed the bond without reading the conditions that applied to their
maintaining their eligibility status). The school authorities were handling the check books in one
training center and the PS has been asked to correct this immediately.
Most students chose to undertake the TSLC/Diploma because of the scholarship; otherwise they
would have chosen other subjects of study. A few would have not undertaken any further studies.
Most students said they would look for work after completing their course of study.
For effective communication and outreach, the students suggested that use of the local FM Radio
(morning, news time, evening), Kantipur (national daily), and notice through schools would be
effective.

B. Training of Trainers (Master Trainers, Lead Trainers, Assistant Trainers)
In the meeting the discussion focused on how trainees got the notice of training, their motivation to apply,
overall management of training and classroom instruction, the quality and adequacy of trainers, training
curriculum, trainees’ assessment and instructional materials. In addition, trainees were asked about their
own assessment of differences in their knowledge, skill and attitude before and after the training.
Key Findings






Master Trainers learnt about the availability of this training through newspaper and website of
EVENT, CTEVT and MOE while lead trainers and assistant trainers got information mostly from
friends and newspapers.
TOT trainees were selected through very competitive entrance tests. They were motivated
because TOT has a good market in various fields including technical education and vocational
training, and TITI has a very good reputation.
The curriculum was relevant and adequate; instructional materials and presentation techniques
were friendly, and delivery in the classroom was impressive.
In every lesson there were two trainers in the classroom. There were qualified experts, resource
persons, and technical assistants that made instruction, interesting and enjoyable.
The specific learning from these trainings were instructional material preparation, use of
instructional materials, presentation skills, micro-teaching for self assessment, motivation
techniques, one on one coaching, correcting trainees’ home work, competency based
individualized learning, questioning techniques, writing skills, active listening, time management,
and so on.
30





Trainees found a big difference before and after the training among themselves. The differences
were found in their knowledge of TOT and rigorous time management skills.
Trainers’ attendance, discipline with regard to trainees’ attendance, reward for good performance
and continuous assessment were also appreciated.
Recommendations made by trainees included: (a) learning content was interesting but time was
too short, (b) equalize per diem amounts for Master Trainers, Lead Trainers and Assistant
Trainers.

C. Training of Assessors (Skill Test Assessors and Skill Test Managers)
In the meeting the discussion focused on how trainees got the notice of training, their motivation to apply,
overall management of training and classroom instruction, the quality and adequacy of trainers, training
curriculum, trainees’ assessment and instructional materials. In addition, trainees were asked about their
own assessment of differences in their knowledge, skill and attitude before and after the training.
Key Findings









Trainees got information from people they knew, newspapers, websites and local FM radios.
Technical professionals were motivated to join to enhance their professional skills, sharpen their
technical expertise, and to be able to take up the opportunity go to different parts of the country.
Some said that being involved in skill test activities would also give them the opportunity for
marketing their business as well.
Some trainees applied through e-mail that made them easy and got reply of their selection by email.
Previously, some of the trainees had been employed as assessors based on their professional
experience. After this training, the trainees said they were able to conduct skill test in a more
organized and systematic way. They now also knew what technical competency was; and how
competency levels were used in a real job at the workplace.
In every lesson there were two trainers in the classroom. There were qualified experts, resource
persons, and technical assistants that made instruction easy. Every minute was interesting and
enjoyable. Time keeping was very strict for both trainers and trainees.
Three days time was enough for training. Training allowances, lunch and training management
was good.
