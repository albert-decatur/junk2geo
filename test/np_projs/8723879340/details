***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
The pace of urbanization in Nepal has increased markedly during 2001 2011 with
an urban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national
population growth of 1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was
estimated to live in urban areas, up from 9.2% in 1991 and 13.9% in 2001. While
global experience clearly demonstrates that urbanization is an important driver
of economic development, the potential has not been adequately tapped in Nepal.
In the absence of a stringent policy regulating and managing growth,
uncontrolled and haphazard urban development has created numerous problems,
including deficiencies in basic urban services; environmental degradation;
encroachment on public land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement
development. Most municipalities in Nepal lack properly engineered and operated
sanitary landfills, and have limited and intermittent water supply services,
poorly maintained road infrastructure, and inadequate drainage systems that
cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai. The Local Self
Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to
municipalities, but the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a
low level of institutional capacity make providing infrastructure facilities
commensurate with the growing demand for services a major challenge. Poor
health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by reducing
labor productivity and educational attainment. Disease, associated economic
burden, and premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable.
**** Impact ****
Improved urban environment in the municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur,
Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar
**** Project Outcome ****
Description of Outcome
Population in project municipalities have inclusively better access to improved
municipal infrastructure and services.
Progress Towards Outcome
There are 10 consulting service packages in total: project management and
support consultant (PMSC) in the PCO; GESI consultant for the GESI Unit; design
and supervision consultants (DSCs) for the four project municipalities of
Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar; and local nongovernment
organization (NGO) services in the four project municipalities. Contracts have
been awarded for all. Technical Bid Evaluation for the drainage and road
subprojects at Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar is in stage of finalization at
PCO. ADB has already provided no objection to issue IFB for SWM projects at
Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj. Design and Bid document of Dharan water supply
project has been finalised. Similarly the design of the drainage and road
project at Janakpur has been finalized and draft bidding document has been
prepared.
**** Implementation Progress ****
Description of Project Outputs
1. Reliable municipal infrastructure developed 2. Community development
programs undertaken and GESI capacity strengthened. 3. Project management and
administration supported.
Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress
TBER of the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj drainage and road subprojects are in
final stage at PCO. Final design and draft bidding document of Janakpur
drainage and road subproject has been prepared. Progress mentioned above. ADB
has already provided concurrence to issue IFB for the Siddharthanagar and
Nepalgunj SWM Subprojects. Regarding Janakpur SWM sub project, site has not yet
been finalized due to social issues. To early to report. Design and Bid
document has been finalised with a target to publish IFB by end of Oct 2014.
Progress mentioned above. Project implementation is being done in this
direction by mobilizing NGOs in Dharan, Janakpur, Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj
Municpalities. 84 TLOs and 3 Users committee formed have more than 33% of women
representatives. Community developement proposals will adreess this issue. GESI
operational guidelines is finalized and toolkits developed for the same. Log
frame of GESI project is prepared. This has been done. PCO and PIUs formed and
core staff appointed. Aduit report and quarterly reports are being submitted
timely. Being complied though there is some delay in Janakpur sub projects.
Implementaion ongoing in this direction.
**** Safeguard Categories ****
Environment: B
Involuntary Resettlement: B
Indigenous Peoples: C
**** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects ****
Environmental Aspect
The project is classified as environmental category B. Four initial
environmental examinations including environmental management plans were
prepared in accordance with ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and
government laws, and disclosed. Subprojects are not located in or near
sensitive or protected areas, and the initial environmental examinations
conclude that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed
locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management
plans provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of
short duration. The net environmental benefits will be positive and large,
including reduced (i) urban flooding from improved drainage systems, (ii)
environmental pollution from improved SWM, and (iii) health and hygiene status
as well as the overall environmental sanitation situation of the selected
povery clusters of the project municipalities will be improved through various
software and hardware activities under small scale community infrastructure.
Implementation arrangements in the PCO build on experience gained through ADB
urban projects, and consultant support will enable the PIUs to manage
environmental impacts. The PCO will provide environmental reports to ADB
semiannually. The project had alredy submitted Semi annual environmental
safeguard monitorting report covering the period of Jan-June 2014. This has
recently been disclosed in ADB's web site.
Involuntary Resettlement
The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and
category C for indigenous peoples. Three draft resettlement plans were prepared
in consultation with affected persons in accordance with the ADB s Safeguard
Policy Statement and disclosed. The project requires minor land acquisition for
construction of sanitary landfills and temporary impacts on vendors during
construction, with no significant resettlement impacts anticipated. Special
assistance measures will be made available to vulnerable groups. The
resettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO,
and adequate consultant inputs have been made available to support
implementation and build capacity to managing resettlement impacts and social
risks. The project has been reporting compliance to social safeguard related
issues by the PIUs in the quarterly as well as semi anuual social safeguard
monitoring report to the ADB. The third semi annual safeguard monitoring report
covering the period of Jan-June 2014 has already been submitted.
Indigenous Peoples
The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and
category C for indigenous peoples. Considering the urban locations of these
subprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected.
**** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation ****
During Project Design
Urban services are limited outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations
restrict further development in the valley, and there is an urgent need to
improve the environment in potential urban centers to promote social and
economic development in other regions of Nepal. The government, represented by
the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC),
developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan,
Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the
basis of (i) economic growth potential, (ii) demand for urban services, and
(iii) urban management capacity. The project directly addresses and conforms to
the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP and Three-Year Plan
Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work as
catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the
employment-centric, equitable, and inclusive economic growth emphasized by the
approach paper. Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully
recognize social differentials in the needs of women, the poor, and excluded
groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets experience discrimination
based on gender, caste, and ethnicity, and multiple exclusions constrain their
progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is
limited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress
has been made through support for their empowerment and mobilization from
various NGOs and development partners. To be effective, urban development must
integrate GESI.
During Project Implementation
The project is in line with the Nepal country partnership strategy of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive
economic growth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity
building, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability.
Reflecting lessons from similar projects, the project (i) focuses on a small
number of physically integrated components, to simplify project administration
and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities
with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the
project and create discernable development impacts; (iii) fully involves
stakeholders, including communities, in project identification and design from
an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before project
implementation; and (v) addresses enforcement of appropriate regulations as an
essential element of managing urban infrastructure effectively. Therefore as
envisioned by the Project, the project coordination office and project
implementation units are doing consultation with the concerned stakeholders as
and when needed and also been disseminating the relevant project related
information to the public. Also due consideration has been given for the
meaningful participation of the concerned project stakeholders in reaching
project related decisions.
 
Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or
program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be
included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.
Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.
