***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Description ****
The TA objective is to enhance both institutional and human resource capacity
of key government agencies in developing and using macroeconomic models and
improve the national statistical system.
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
Institutional capacity for economic policy analysis in Nepal is weak and as a
result, public policy formulation is often not based on a sound analytical
foundation. The need for sound economic policy analysis has become even more
critical over the years in view of the stagnating economic growth and for
better understanding the evolving structure of Nepal?s economy, its increasing
complexity and the interactions between different economic sectors. Economic
policy analysis has also been constrained by Nepal?s weak national statistical
system, particularly the lack of quality and timely macroeconomic data. Given
the importance of reliable and timely macroeconomic data for policy analysis,
ADB has also been assisting the Government in strengthening Nepal?s weak
statistical system. Recent assistance in this respect includes: (i) TA 3451-NEP
(completed in 2004): Strengthening the National Statistical System, which
helped in developing a consolidated national statistical plan (CNSP), and
improving compilation of the NA, agriculture statistics development and poverty
monitoring, and (ii) TA 4460-NEP: Strengthening the National Accounts System
(near completion), which supported migration of the national accounts to the
System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993, benchmarking and rebasing the national
accounts estimates, and development of a system of compiling quarterly national
accounts. Also, a diagnostic study was conducted on Nepal?s statistical system
under RETA 6333: Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia Pacific Region,
which recommended adoption of the CNSP without further delay and identified a
broad range of long-term statistical capacity building (SCB) needs of the
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS, the main statistical agency) and other
Government agencies.
**** Impact ****
Economic policies based on an improved statistical system (national accounts)
and sound quantitative macroeconomic analysis.
**** Project Outcome ****
Description of Outcome
Component A: (i) A more conducive legal and institutional environment for
improving the national statistical system. (ii) A system of QNAcompilation
established. Component B: Macroeconomic tools developed for short- to medium-
term macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis.
Progress Towards Outcome
While the legal and institutional reforms are still underway, the system of
compiling QNA data has been streamlined. NMEM is institutionalized and the DSGE
model finalized.
**** Implementation Progress ****
Description of Project Outputs
Component A: Enactment of the new Statistical Act, more autonomous CBS, and
more functional National Statistical Council (NSC) Component A: Quarterly GDP
estimates for FY2007 FY2010 Component B: Upgrade of the Nepal Macroeconomic
Model (NMEM) Compoent B: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)-type
model developed for Nepal Component B: User manual to undertake the
quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting
Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress
- Draft Statiscal Act being submitted to the Cabinet. - Quarterly GDP estimates
for all sectors completed. - User manual to undertake the quantitative
macroeconomic analysis and forecasting prepared. - DSGE model finalized and
submitted to NRB. - Upgradation of the NMEM completed.
**** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation ****
During Project Design
The project was included in the country program on the request of the
Government (mainly Central Bureau of Statistics and Nepal Rastra Bank). The TA
was prepared in full consultation with the Government agencies.
During Project Implementation
Ongoing.
 
Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or
program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be
included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.
Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.
