***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details *****
**** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy ****
The proposed loan and grants will directly address the urgent needs attributed
to the electricity supply crisis in Nepal, through rehabilitation of two
hydropower plants, supply-side energy efficiency, and demand-side management.
The transmission network strengthening will also add supply capacity by
increasing evacuation of power from hydropower stations in the western region
and allow increased energy imports across the western border in the short term.
In the medium term, the transmission network strengthening will allow cross-
border energy exports, while distribution strengthening will facilitate
additional consumer connections and increased energy efficiency. PPPs in
distribution will help the NEA to pilot private sector involvement in improving
distribution efficiency. These project interventions will also lead to improved
financial performance of the NEA and sustainability of the sector through
increased revenues, reduced losses, and improved efficiency.
**** Impact ****
Increased access to electricity across the country
**** Project Outcome ****
Description of Outcome
Reliable and energy efficient power supply with increased access and
operational efficiency in the project areas.
Progress Towards Outcome
The works are ongoing and the outcome is likely to be achieved.

Involuntary Resettlement:
Indigenous Peoples:
**** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects ****
Environmental Aspect
The Government of Nepal has undertaken initial environmental examinations and
developed an environmental management plan for all relevant packages and
included in the bidding/contract documents.
Involuntary Resettlement
A full resettlement plan (RP) was prepared during project preparation in
consultation with affected parties, local authorities, and the NEA, in
accordance with ADB s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The project
requires a total of 4.66 ha of land for permanent acquisition and 21.39 ha land
requires restriction of use for TL right of way (ROW).However, the routing of
transmission line is slightly changed during implementation of 1 package to
reduce the impacts. Thus EA is currently in the process to update the RP.
Indigenous Peoples
No adverse impact is expected on indigenous people s communities.
**** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation ****
During Project Design
Consultation with NEA officials was focused to solicit project-related data and
documents and to gather further information required for project preparation
activities. District stakeholders were consulted to inform them about the
project, collect required information and suggestions relevant to the project,
and seek their support tor project preparation. Consultation with the local
community, including the project-affected families, was undertaken to (i)
disseminate information about the proposed projects and likely impacts, (ii)
solicit their view and suggestion, (iii) collect socioeconomic and census data,
(iv) assess the scope of effects on private and community assets, (v) financial
assistance to be made to the affected people.
During Project Implementation
Regular review missions and regular meetings are conducted by ADB.
