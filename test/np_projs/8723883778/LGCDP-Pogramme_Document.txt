Introduction 

1.1 

Background 

The Government of Nepal (GON) is committed to bringing about tangible changes in the local
governance and community development process. The aim is to improve the living standards of the
people through community led development, efficient service delivery, good governance, based on a
democratic value system and rights-based approach and inclusive development efforts subsequent to
the restructuring of the state. This will be based on the conceptual framework of federal, inclusive and
participatory development, with the implementation of local level development initiatives under the
leadership of local autonomous government. The focus of the local development programme will be to
support poverty alleviation measures based on the fundamental premises of inclusive development,
and through the mobilisation of local resources and use of local skills and technology opportunities – all
with the direct involvement of local citizens and community organisations.
At present, a major task of the GON is to substantiate the objectives, policies and principles of the Local
Self-Governance Act (LSGA), 2055 and to translate the principles of local self-governance into practice
through the mobilisation of local bodies and local communities with the facilitation and support of the
central line ministries. The LSGA provides the legal basis for the involvement of civil society
organisations (CSO) in formulating plans for the local bodies.
A shared commitment to work together for this purpose exists between the Ministry of Local
Development (MLD) and the Development Partners (DPs). Given the need of improving local
governance and participatory approaches to establish robust accountability of local government to
communities, the current political scenarios and the earlier tendency of DPs to pursue their own
priorities with discrete programmes in separate geographic areas, this convergence is a major
achievement. Now, the need to bring the private and NGO sectors into the planning and
implementation process and to enable better engagement of local communities in the local governance
reform process to ensure that services are responsive to their needs, has been recognised.
MLD’s vision on local governance and community development is to bring improvement in the living
standard of the masses through local good governance based on a democratic value system and
inclusive development effort subsequent to the restructuring of the state, based on the conceptual
framework of federal, inclusive and participatory development, with the execution of the local level
development initiatives under the leadership of local autonomous government.
A number of development partners have signed a letter of intent to provide programme support within
the areas of local governance and community development. Some development partners intend to
provide further support over a longer period of time. Although government structures and systems are
likely to change over the coming years, LGCDP will be the first phase of a longer term programme of
support to local governance and community development strengthening both the demand and the
supply sides of local service delivery and good governance to attain the LSGA spirit. The programme
strongly supports MLD’s vision of local development and self-governance to bring good governance
and development interventions to the people by maintaining fiscal discipline, correcting
mismanagement, delays and non-transparent procedures.
This programme will be the national programme framework for achieving improvements in the system
of local governance and community development. The underlying intention of the LGCDP is to move
7

the local governance and community development sector towards a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) for
decentralisation.

1.2 

The New Nepal 

The peace process started in June 2006, with the signing of the eight-point agreement between the
Seven Party Alliance (SPA) and the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) Maoist. The comprehensive
peace agreement, concluded between the GON and the CPN (Maoist) in November 2006 guaranteed a
political system based on universally accepted fundamental human rights, a competitive multiparty
democratic system, constitutional checks and balances, independent judiciary, periodic elections,
participation by civil society, press freedom, people’s right to information, transparency and
accountability in the activities of political parties, peoples’ participation and the concepts of impartial,
competent, and fair administration.
The Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007) reflects the commitments made by the SPA and the CPN
(Maoist) and sets the future direction for the social, political and economic transformation of Nepal. It
guarantees social justice and affirmative action for women, dalits, indigenous groups, the madhesi
community, and other excluded or disadvantaged groups. The Interim Constitution also proposes the
future restructuring of the state to promote and institutionalise an inclusive, democratic and progressive
local governance system, maximising people's participation based on decentralisation, devolution of
power and the equitable distribution of resources to local bodies.
Elections were successfully completed to form a Constituent Assembly (CA) including holding its first
meeting. The CA will also set out the arrangements for the future federal structure of the state; this
Assembly will also serve as a national legislature and form a new cabinet until the general election
takes place.

1.3 

Opportunities  

In the context of the unfolding peace process and renewed commitment by the GON and the
international community to support local governance, a number of opportunities have emerged:
a) The major political parties (Maoists, NC, UML, and MPRF), in their CA election manifestos,
have stated their commitment to an inclusive democratic and federal system of government
and to devolve local level and community development related functions to local bodies.
They have expressed active commitments towards state restructuring to ensure a
decentralised, accountable, people-oriented, and democratic self governance system;
ending all forms of discrimination, economic exploitation and to address the needs of
disadvantaged groups including women, dalits, janajatis, madheshis, old aged, disabled
and remote regions and communities by ensuring their participation in state mechanisms,
development and empowerment.
b) The likely return to elected local representation in local bodies in the years ahead presents
the opportunity to begin to strengthen downward accountability in the local government
system – and to help redefine the relationship between local administrations and local
communities and promoting more constructive interaction. Elected local bodies would be in
place after promulgation of the new Constitution. In the meantime, GON has made
provisions to fill in the DDC, Municipalities and Village Development Committees by allparty mechanism on the basis of one party one representative, comprising of seven
8

political parties, as mentioned in the interim constitution of Nepal and other political parties
who have obtained more than 10 percent verdict of the people (either in proportional or first
past the post election of CA) at the district level. These bodies will be given the
responsibilities of coordination, planning, conflict resolution, monitoring, and review; and
will be able to interact with local community organizations and individual members of the
community in planning and decision making on local governance issues.
c) There have been positive developments towards improving functioning of the local
government since the signing of the peace accord between the political parties. A greater
number of VDCs have now become more operational again. District Development
Committees (DDCs) and Municipalities remain operational, and – to varying degrees –
have done so throughout the conflict.
d) The Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction has constituted Local Peace Committees (LPC)
at the district level in 29 districts and intends to establish them in all 75 districts. The LPC is
also an all party mechanism represented by the chiefs of all the political parties with
representation of women, janajati and dalits. There are opportunities to improve linkages
with such innovative initiatives in regard to planning and funds flow with the DDC.
e) As the peace process deepens and interim arrangements firm up, local bodies are
becoming more functional. This will provide the opportunity to foster greater organic links
between local governments and communities.
f) The government is committed to increasing the volume of fiscal transfers to local bodies,
and has, for example, increased the size of VDC block grants from 0.5 million Rs. to 1.0
million. Increased fiscal transfers from the government to local bodies provide the
opportunity to strengthen and improve the quality of local infrastructure, service delivery,
and empower the community – and will directly contribute to the process of post-conflict
reconstruction and recovery. Equally, this also serves as a GON commitment to
decentralisation. Similarly, GON is also moving ahead to link allocation of transfers of
resources to DDCs and other local governments as a basic measure to improve good
governance.
g) There is a body of promising innovations and of good practice which have been developed
in the country in the past years with the support of various development partners and also
NGOs, in regard to both local government, social mobilisation and community
support/development, community led prioritization of local needs and also of lessons
learned (good and bad), which can inform future programme activities, and facilitate more
rapid and efficient implementation of the proposed programme.
h) There is a need to improve service delivery at the national and local governments and
increase confidence of the people in the governance system. Restoring or increasing the
confidence of the people in their government is absolutely crucial for securing a durable
peace, and it is therefore important that the GON and development partners work closely
together to this end.
i)

There is also now a growing realization that there are opportunities to make local
governments effective and accountable not only by strengthening them alone but also by
enabling communities to have greater ‘voice’ in how they shape their development space,
and how they wish to engage with local governments. The underlying premise here is that
9

of upward pressures to enhance good local governance by focusing on communities as
well.
j)

1.4 

Finally, there is now momentum in favour of a harmonised approach by the EDPs to begin
to work together to support a national programme. This is underscored by the issuing of
joint Guiding Principles in January 2008, by the joint Statement of GON and development
partners at the Nepal Donor Consultation meeting in February 2008, and by MLD’s
commitment to lead the LGCDP strategically.

Challenges to be addressed 

Notwithstanding these opportunities, the current situation presents some fairly substantial challenges
which the LGCDP will have to address:
• Absence of elected representatives, since 2002, in the local bodies has created leadership
vacuum and affected the local government system over the last decade in the country. Violent
conflict resulted in the “demobilisation” of the vast majority of VDCs, and narrowed down the
“development space” within which DDCs could operate. In some of the VDCs the VDC
secretary is still providing services from outside the VDC. This has greatly constrained the
scope for interaction between the local governments and communities, and because there are
no elected representatives, has minimized the scope for instituting downwards accountability to
citizens and communities. As a consequence, there has been a supporting vacuum resulting in
a low level of participation by local people in development activities.
• Efforts to translate the political commitments of the political parties to strengthen local selfgovernance, state restructuring and the engagement of local bodies with communities to focus
into on the broader issues of delivering public goods and services, will be a challenge for any
development intervention at the local government level. The overall post-conflict situation
throughout the country will have an impact on LGCDP. Although the political situation in the
country is gradually improving, there are still a few disturbances in some parts i.e. Terai. It
demands flexible modalities to support local governance (working in partnership with civil
society, the private sector, local NGOs and Communities) in those areas where conflict reignites.
• The long term future for elected local government will depend largely upon the provisions of the
new constitution. The outcomes of the future national policy deliberations on federalism and
meso as well as local level government structure in the country are difficult to predict in terms of
their implications for local government. It implies that support to local governance will need to
be very flexible and process-oriented.
• Making local governments more sensitive to the "needs" and “voice” of children, women, Dalits,
Madhesis, Adibasis Janajatis, and other traditionally marginalised groups is very challenging.
The country is a highly stratified society, within which women and the under-privileged exert
very little power and within which they find it difficult to articulate their needs and be listened to.
Addressing this issue will be a major challenge.
• Rapid urbanisation is a challenge for effective municipal governance in Nepal.
• Lastly, there remain challenges as to how to adapt “social mobilisation” activities in a manner
which allows broad-based as well as targeted community interaction with local government, and
10

promotes downward accountability of the latter; which also successfully addresses the
predicaments of the marginalised and “hard-to-reach” segments of rural society; but which can
be undertaken at national scale within a short time frame, rather than in a few “favoured” areas
over many years.

1.5 

The Policy Environment for Decentralisation & Local Governance  

Government policy has been consistent in confirming its commitment to equity and meeting the needs
of the poor through the delivery of services at the local level.
Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2063(2007): The Interim Constitution has made the following
provisions:
• Conducive environment will be created to promote people’s participation at the grassroots level
and create local self-reliant institutional mechanisms to provide services to the people at the
local level through decentralisation as an integral part of the governance.
• Interim Local Bodies at district, municipality and village level will be created as per consensus
made by the political parties.
• Balanced approach will be taken in resource mobilisation, allocation and equitable distribution
of development results.
• Roles and responsibilities of the local bodies will be delineated to make them more accountable
in planning and implementation of local level services including revenue mobilisation and
allocation. Special attention will be given to uplift the socially and economically backward
classes and communities in revenue mobilisation and allocation.
The LSGA has established a solid policy and legal framework for local bodies – which is based on local
bodies at the district, municipality and village levels.
Decentralisation Implementation and Monitoring Committee (DIMC): LSGA has legally created the
DIMC under the chair of Hon. Prime Minister with high level representatives as member e.g. Ministers,
Leader of Opposition Party, Chairperson of the concerned Committee of the House of Representatives,
One representative each of political party representing the parliament, Vice-chairperson of National
Planning Commission, Chief Secretary and other Secretaries of GON and representatives of political
parties and local bodies association.
LSGA has provisioned to form the Decentralisation Implementation and Monitoring Working Committee
(DIMWC) under the chair of Minister for Local Development and members from different spheres of
local self-governance sector. A Decentralisation Implementation Plan (DIP), a roadmap for the
transformation of LSGA, has been prepared by the DIMC in 2000 and started its implementation.
Currently, the DIMC and DIMWC is dys-functional as well as the DIP.
Local Infrastructure Development Policy: Local Infrastructure Development Policy was formulated in
2004 as per the provisions of the LSGA. GON has divided the development of infrastructure between
the strategic or central level and local level after promulgation of the policy. The infrastructure related
works at decentralised levels is defined for each infrastructure sector according to the nature of local
infrastructure by the policy. The policy makes the local infrastructure responsibility of the District
Development Committee (DDC), Municipality and Village Development Committee (VDC). Strategic
Plan for the Local Infrastructure Development Policy has also been approved by MLD.

11

The Three-Year Interim Plan (2007/08 to 2009/10) has specified decentralisation as a main means of
enhancing good governance, a process of administrative, political, social, and economic and
development works, and a strategy for promoting peoples’ participation and people’s empowerment.
The following are strategies to improve local governance and community development to address the
aforementioned challenges:
• Demand driven, targeted and community focused and specific goal-oriented schemes and
social mobilisation programs will be implemented to increase the access of people from remote
areas, women, children, Dalits, Adibasi Janjatis, Madheshis, Muslims, exploited, marginalised,
minority, disadvantaged and other backward groups to resources and opportunities through
their increased participation and ownership. TYIP refers to government’s commitment to child
participation and child friendly local governance.
• The perception of good governance through the strengthening of the local self- governance
system will be developed by mobilising internal and external resources for the local bodies and
facilitating their effective utilisation, as well as through capacity building, sector wide devolution
and through the coordinated efforts of other local level stakeholders.
• Human resource development plans on capacity enhancement will be prepared and
implemented in the areas relevant to local development. Training sessions will be organised at
local level by creating ownership of local authorities.
• Emphasis will be given to partnerships with NGOs and the private sector. All governmental,
non-governmental and private sectors will be made responsible for facilitating decentralisation
and devolution as the major policy for central government and vehicle for the consolidation of
the local authorities.
• Special attention will be given to the mobilisation and sharing of revenues between local
authorities so as to ensure equitable development and to help the overall development of
socially and economically backward places, classes and communities. Grants to local bodies
will be incorporated within the framework of minimum conditions and performance measures.
The total budget allocated to local bodies and the sector-specific central budget will be adjusted
scientifically.
The Government’s Foreign Aid policy underlines the need for all development programmes and
projects to be subject to full ownership by the GON in order to ensure harmonisation and coordination
and for development partners to work with the Foreign Aid Joint Coordination Committee in order to
avoid duplication and to gradually move towards sector-wide approaches.
Governance (Management and Operation) Act, 2008 underlines measures for people oriented,
accountable, transparent, inclusive and participatory public administration to provide its benefits to
general people, to:
• instigate good governance principles and norms such as rule of law, corruption less tidy
administration, decentralisation, fiscal discipline and public functions, skilled management of
resources to create public service receiving environment rapid
• transform civic rights to governance into practice
• make legal provision to transform administrative mechanism towards service provider and
facilitator to foster realisation of governance in the country
The act makes general provisions on operation of administration at different levels such as central,
regional, zonal, district and local level with basic fundamental mandates for administrative functions and
policies to be followed by GON. It spells administrative functions and responsibility of officials at
12

different levels such as Minister, Chief Secretary, Secretary, Department Chief and Office Chief
including work procedure to be adopted during administration.
The act specifies self-positional responsibilities of civil servants and makes mandatory provision to keep
citizen charter, providing mobile services, determining service fees on the basis of social justice,
participation and ownership of people, setting up of Governance Reform Unit in government agencies,
conducting public hearing, managing grievances, pursuing information technology in practice, setting up
M&E committee and submission of annual report by GON agencies.
The Gender Equality/Social Inclusion commitments and policies of the Government such as the
Universal Declaration of Human rights, covenants on Economic, Cultural and Social rights, covenants
on Political and Civil rights, International commitments made by the GON, such as CEDAW
(Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women), the Convention of Child
Rights, ILO convention 169 for indigenous and tribal people, etc. underscores the provisions for
adopting gender equality and social inclusion friendly approaches in GON programmes.
MLD and all its development partners have recently developed Guiding Principles towards Harmonised
Local Governance & Community Led Local Development Approach, which
• provide a common framework for funding public and community services, infrastructure and
other assets which will be channelled through local government and be allocated according to
and reflected in local government planning & budgeting processes, depending on the
respective functions of the different levels; in this, the VDCs will play the key role in funding
destined for community-led proposals, and in monitoring all development activities in their
jurisdictions; and
• Requires that procedures for working with communities, and for targeting the poorest and most
disadvantaged segments of these communities, be rationalised and harmonised in order to
ensure greater equity and efficiency, and to reduce transaction costs for the communities
themselves.
MLD has developed a concept paper (July 2007) on local development and self-governance to
bring good governance and development interventions to people by reducing corruption, commission,
mismanagement, delays and non-transparent procedures. MLD sets the future direction as follows:
• Functional devolution process to be followed to empower people and devolve power to local
bodies for self-governance;
• Awareness raising to transform state machinery to become more participatory, responsive,
accountable, inclusive, and transparent to serve the people;
• Implementation of infrastructure development programmes as livelihood options;
• Purification process from the leadership level to eradicate corruption, commissions, unfair
norms, favouritism, partisanship, delays and misappropriation;
• Targeted programs for DAG, the poor and communities to make service delivery more
equitable and more easily accessible; and
• Transformation from traditional mindsets and external dependency.
In its concept paper, MLD has prioritised the following policies and programs:
• Change in mindsets/thinking through awareness raising campaigns and structural policy reform
• Restructuring of state and local government

Inclusive and democratic federal forms of government
Three levels of government – Central, State and Local
Local self-governance at the local level
Local autonomy and service delivery to be ensured by the formation of LBs by all party
committees that work through consensus and coordination, promotion of e-governance,
revision of Act, Policy, Laws and Directives, accountability to people, developing Code of
Conduct for both the political representatives and bureaucrats and capacity development for
service delivery. Through Local Body Fiscal Commission (LBFC), MLD proposes to strengthen
financial monitoring, proper management of revenue collection, public-private partnerships,
Minimum Conditions and Performance Measures (MC/PM) adoption for grant allocation and
people’s ownership of projects. MLD intends to bring all government service centres/line
agencies into Service Backup Centres at the Ilaka (sub-district) level to provide technical
assistance to VDCs.
Social security: through special allowances and other social assistance schemes (senior citizen
allowances, support to the destitute, Persons with Disabilities (PWD), widowers’ allowances);

positive discrimination and Vital Event Registration System computerization.
DAG empowerment and community development: Special focused programs for DAG such as
women, Adabashi, Janajati, marginalised, Dalit, Madheshi; social audit; poverty alleviation
programme for the Karnali region (OFOE - One family one employment); remote area
development; supplementary and complementary roles of NGOs, private and government
sectors. Demands of COs to be integrated into local level planning process;
Local infrastructure development
Coordination and support
Good governance (budget ceilings, rights based development at the local level, notice boards,
social/public audits, use of print and electronic media to ensure transparency in programmes
and budgets, monitoring & evaluation, and results based development).
Paralegal committees for community mediation

Programme Justification 

2.1.  Programme Rationale 
The programme is premised on a number of considerations:
A key element in poverty reduction - is a dramatic improvement in peace establishment through the
political settlement; delivery of basic public goods and services (health, education, communication,
water, sanitation, senior citizen pensions etc.); and providing the desired services as collective
infrastructure, livelihood options, and other services to the communities, especially in rural areas;
In a post-conflict context, the need to ensure a tangible peace dividend and a framework for recovery is
seen as being a major justification for the programme.
LGCDP will positively contribute to constitutional debates and discussions related to devolution
and the governance process at the local level with its local level capacity development component,
flexible approaches in integrating local communities/groups into the planning process, and making the
LBs accountable to people will benefit the future federal state with strong LBs at the local level.

14

Ad hoc distribution of grant needs improvement - criteria based grants will be provided to the local
bodies instead of ad hoc distribution. Top up grants will be provided for equitable distribution of the
resources to local bodies as part of the peace dividend.
Aid effectiveness and harmonisation is necessary for resource synergy and to reduce transaction
costs – a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) for decentralisation will be pursued to internalise the
provisions of the Foreign Aid Policy of the country including the Paris Declaration.
Enabling and strengthening community involvement in local governance processes – in particular
by ensuring community decision rights in planning and programming, prioritizing, budgeting,
implementing and evaluation of local level programmes and budgets and finding ways to ensure
effective representation of the ultra-poor and marginalised groups in these deliberations.
Local government and administration has both a potential comparative advantage and a legal
mandate to “provide” (finance and ensure delivery of) such goods and services. Central ministries are
too far away and tend to provide blueprint, one size fits all services without regard to local context and
subject to few accountability pressures; other non-state agencies such as NGOs simply cannot operate
to national scale, and are also not subject to local accountability pressures; and community
organisations cannot themselves manage public finances or adequately make overall budget priorities
for the delivery of these goods and services (other than the very local, micro-schemes of immediate
community group interest), although they do play a key role in articulating local priorities and needs,
and ensuring accountability.
The local government enjoys a potential comparative advantage, the important areas are to:
• support increase local government funds, simplify funds flow, develop appropriate reporting
formats and improve reporting in local bodies;
• make planning, budgeting and public expenditure management procedures transparent
including regular and frequent communications with local communities and personnel;
• strengthen capacity of local level decision-makers, office-bearers, community groups, own staff
etc. through regular training and support;
• develop human resources plans for its own staffing needs and local technical needs;
• strengthen monitoring and supervision by central government;
• ensure a policy and regulatory framework to make it conducive to local good governance; and
• accountable local government and administration towards the community and people.

Programme Description  

3.1 

Programme Duration 

The programme is designed for four years for first phase. However, it is expected to continue beyond
2012. Several DPs have expressed interest to further continue their support beyond 2012.
3.1.1   Approach Period  
Approach period of the LGCDP will be from June to July 15, 2008, prior to the launch of the
programme, to undertake a range of preparatory activities. The MLD and its DPs, with support from a
small team of specialised consultants, should jointly launch a detailed assessment of the institutional
capacity and preparedness of MLD to perform the tasks and to deliver the capacity building support
required in the short to medium term.
15

This will also depart into more detail in terms of determining existing capacities and TA needs and fix
the timeline, review efficient ways and means to organise the work, elaborate job descriptions/TOR for
core staff, TA and define linkages between MLD and other partners involved. It will also review the
options for physically housing the new PCU team and other support staff in the MLD premises etc.
3.1.2  Inception Phase  
The LGCDP Inception Phase will be from July 16, 2008 to January 2009. The Phase will be used to
start implementation of activities and prepare for a full roll-out of systems, procedures and capacity
building support in a flexible way.

3.2 

Key Principles and Approaches  

The following are the principles and approaches which underlie the LGCDP as GON’s national
programme:
a) Alignment with government policies including Three-year Interim Plan and MLD Concept
Paper on Local Development and Self Governance: LGCDP will be the basis for the
implementation of the Three-year Interim Plan (2007/08 – 2009/10) as a GON programme in
support of decentralisation and local governance, to which MLD and development partners recently
committed. In addition, MLD concept paper (July 2007) which set the future direction of MLD on
devolution, local governance and community development activities. It will be designed and
implemented in compliance with the present Constitution and the LSGA and related regulations
(until new policy & legislation are in place).
b) Inclusiveness and gender equity: The strategic goal of LGCDP will be to promote inclusive local
democracy, through local community-led development that enables the active engagement of
citizens from all sections of society. LGCDP will support socially inclusive and gender and child
friendly approaches in the design and implementation of its programmes. Affirmative action policies
will be introduced in favour of poor, women and disadvantaged communities to maximise their
participation in, and benefits from the programme intervention. Leadership and managerial skills of
women and disadvantaged communities (Dalit, Janajatis and others) will be improved through
capacity building that leads to their empowerment. Procedures for working with communities, and
for targeting the poorest and most disadvantaged segments of these communities, will be
rationalised and harmonised in order to ensure greater equity and efficiency, and to reduce
transaction costs for the communities themselves. The strategy for all activities will aim at
approaches which can be rapidly mainstreamed and scaled-up to national level, and not be
“excessively resource intensive, NGO-type experiments” which have no hope of wider replication.
c) Community-led development: The programme will operate so as to support community-led
development, defined as an approach where citizens and communities either individually or
collectively, as active partners in the local governance process, prioritise, implement or fulfil their
basic needs through collective action. Users’ committee guidelines will be improved to address the
above.
d) Rights-based participatory approach: LGCDP will operate according to a rights-based approach
based on participatory planning and the development of demand-responsive service providers at
local government level. The focus will be on those aspects of poverty reduction which can be
addressed through social mobilisation and local government-supported activity (but not on others,
16

e.g. those requiring micro-finance). Social mobilisation and LDF experiences and their best
practices adopted in Nepal will be reflected in the new guidelines. LGCDP is committed to advocate
for civil rights and to support the emergence and growth of Dalit, differently-abled and women
organisations which defend their rights at the local level.
e) Adoption of flexible and process-oriented approach: The programme will work to translate
GON’s commitments to strengthen local self-governance, state restructuring and the engagement
of local bodies with communities with the aim of improving the delivering public goods and services
at the local government level. Thus, support to local governance will be flexible and processoriented. This includes consideration of innovative and flexible ways to ensure that the primary
program outcome of responsive, inclusive, and accountable local governance through participatory
community-led development is attained.
f) Peace building: The programme will follow conflict sensitive implementation approach, promoting
factors in support of reconciliation and peace building and avoiding those that inhibiting peace or
stimulate conflict/violence at the local level. LGCDP will coordinate with the Local Peace
Committees (LPC) formed at the district level. The LPCs are constituted by all party representation
and function as an early warning mechanism to minimise conflict. The LPCs can build linkages with
existing peace groups and networks at the VDC level and can provide support to improve
government-citizen interaction.
g) The programme will support development of a clear policy and strategy to address the needs of
the children, young people, women, conflict victims (families of martyrs disappeared and wounded
people) and the disadvantaged. Towards this end, the programme will seek to ensure that their
voices are heard in key decision-making processes at the local level, including, to the extent
possible, by mainstreaming and institutionalizing their participation in such institutions. This is one
specific way by which downward accountability of local governments to the disadvantaged
populations can be better ensured.
h) Transparency and accountability: The LGCDP will ensure transparency in all its operations
budgets, decision making process, and communication to all actors, coordination among line
agencies and non-state agencies and in reaching to the remote areas to focus on tangible benefits
of the programme at local level. The programme will delineate roles and responsibilities of all the
actors and use a systemic programme implementation approach to increase accountability at all
levels.
i)

Performance/criteria based funding: Funding will be allocated to allow a substantial increase in
GON’s current annual grant support to local governments nation-wide, to augment funding
available for such goods and services, and also to introduce incentives for better local performance
and compliance with agreed governance standards through modified use of the Minimum
Conditions/Performance Measures System to pursue implementation of the performance based
management provisions of the LSGA. These general, unconditional grant funds will be open for
local government expenditure on the “menu” of public goods and services mandated by the LSGA
to that particular level of government. A systematised criteria based local development fee will be
allocated to the municipalities.

j)

Harmonised approach: The design of the LGCDP will reflect the “Guiding Principles towards
Harmonised Local Governance & Community Led Local Development Approach”, recently
adopted by all partners. Specifically, it will provide a common framework for funding public and
community services, infrastructure and other public assets which will be channelled through central
17

and local government, and be allocated according to and reflected in local government planning &
budgeting processes, depending on the respective functions of the different levels. In this, the
VDCs will play the key role in funding destined for community-led proposals, and in monitoring all
development activities in their jurisdictions. Thus, LGCDP will be a framework to harmonise the
multiple donor and NGO projects and to lay the basis for a SWAp in support of decentralised local
governance and community development. LGCDP will be a joint programme, bringing together UN
agencies (UNDP, UNCDF, UNICEF, UNV and UNFPA); bilateral agencies (DFID, Norway,
DANIDA, CIDA, SDC, JICA, GTZ and others); and multilateral banks (World Bank and ADB etc.)
k) Downward accountability: The following measures would be adopted to ensure downward
accountability to the people and communities; they include: VDC selection will be made based
upon category 4 of DAG mapping and gradually category 3, 2, and 1 will be covered by the
program; interim all party mechanism at the VDC level will be activated; planning advisory
committee will be formed at the VDC level representing civil society, technocrats, and other
concern stakeholders; and at the DDC level Integrated Planning Committee will be strengthened;
social & public audit system will be placed; income & expenditure will be disclosed in a routine
basis during the program period; LB's level public hearing system will be introduced; and
participatory planning process will be adopted fully to address the prioritized project of the
communities.
l)

Mechanism of hearing people voices: People's / DAG voice will be heard through the
mechanism of participation; social mobilization process and response will be taken by the LBs. LB's
will coordinate local NGO and civil society, and optimize their resources. Civil society raise the
voice of the disadvantaged and marginal people; Indigenous Nationalized district coordination
Committee; District Dalits Coordination Committee, District Gender Mainstreaming Committee will
be further mobilized to address the voice of the people. Addition to these paralegal committee will
be strengthened for the mediation against the domestic violence; and to raise the voice of women,
children, youth, dalits, janjati , madhesi, muslim, disables and DAG etc. Finally Planning Advisory
Committee will ensure these voices are incorporated in the annual work plan and budget.

3.3 

Programme Interventions 

LGCDP will intervene in the following strategic areas:
3.3.1  Empowerment  of  citizens  and  communities  for  active  engagement  with 
local governments and strengthening downward accountability 
This aspect of LGCDP is particularly important in the current context where there are no elected local
councils. This situation creates the need to pay more attention on downward accountability of local
governments. This temporary absence of democratic representation at the local level makes it
especially important that LGCDP support community organizations as mechanisms through which all
citizens – and especially those from marginalized groups -- can interact with the local authorities and
other service providing agencies to have a say in the prioritizations and oversight of local level public
funds. It will promote more active and effective interaction by communities – and especially of the more
marginalised segments – with their local governments, thereby helping to better articulate community
voice, foster community-led development, and hold local governments to account for the services they
are supposed to deliver (“micro-level” or “demand”).
The LGCDP strategy within this field will be to institutionalise community involvement in discussions
and decision making regarding planning, monitoring and implementation of government budgets at the
18

local level, through development of various mechanisms for community participation in local
governance. These mechanisms or “rules of the game” will require that local authorities seek broad
community involvement and endorsement of decisions on the use of the local block grant as defined in
the local body grant guidelines. At the same time LGCDP will support a comprehensive social
mobilization effort to ensure that communities are furnished with the capacity to fulfil this role in an
inclusive and accountable manner, through a comprehensive social mobilisation effort. It is envisioned
that in communities where there are already active community organizations of various types, that
LGCDP would work primarily to ensure that the existing organizations are participating in the local
governances processes as outlined by the LGCDP in an inclusive, transparent and democratic manner
and that all elements in the community they serve – rich and poor, women and men, children and all
caste/ethnic groups – have adequate representation. Where no organizations exist, LGCDP’s social
mobilisation efforts will be directed towards helping to form and build the capacity of such organizations
that can represent their constituents in local governance processes as outlined by the LGCDP.
LGCDP will build on the considerable body of existing experience in community participation and social
mobilisation generated by several past and ongoing programmes. To this end improved guidelines on
community participation, social mobilisation and LDF operational guidelines will be prepared in the
inception phase and form the basis for development of a detailed community participation and social
mobilisation strategy to be applied by the programme2.
As social mobilisation is identified as the principal means for empowering communities and community
organisations, the following procedures may be followed3:
• DDCs will contract out the Social Mobilisation services to appropriate institutions (private sector
or LDF or civil society) based on competitive processes.
• A comprehensive SM training programme and operational manual will be designed by LGCDP.
All service providers and social mobilisers will be trained and provided with an Operational
Manual developed under the supervision of LGCDP – with a view towards ensuring a common
approach.
• Robust outcome-based monitoring of the performance of social mobilisers (and their support
organizations) will be put in place by the LGCDP – with poor performance and failure to achieve
the outcomes being accompanied by sanctions.
• New VDCs/ward of municipalities will be selected on the basis of DAG mapping using tools
already developed by MLD.
• DDC will map out the SM agencies (coverage, methodologies etc.) and assess their
performance and potential.
• DDCs may select appropriate agencies (existing social mobilisers, CBOs, NGOs, private
sector) to undertake SM activities.
• VDCs will target the most disadvantaged and poorest families by using appropriate criteria.

2

LGCDP will experiment – in areas where conditions permit – with ascertaining the degree to which
communities can take the lead role in determining their own priorities, and through access to dedicated funds
(and with technical support from local bodies) fulfill their development needs, not necessarily only at the micro
level but also in terms of linking up with other communities that may share the same development need/priority.
The strength and appeal of the LGCDP is that it has the scope to test innovative and flexible methods of
attaining the same vision and outcome.
3
Given the centrality of the role of social mobilisers in empowering communities as envisaged in the Program,
specific criteria for their selection will be determined for the new positions; these could include, among others,
hired based on merit/technical capacity and credibility amongst local constituents.

19

The social mobilisers’ primary functions will be strengthening local voice and increasing the extent to
which local groups and communities can participate actively in the decision making on the use of the
block grant and hold their local governments and service delivery agencies to account. This does not
detract from the option for socially mobilised groups and organisations to engage with various agencies
or programmes to access livelihoods-based assistance.
A community led social development approach will be followed that will strengthen community
participation in local governance. The LGCDP socially mobilised groups will be able to influence the use
of block grants and in many cases be the implementing body in the production of goods and services by
engaging with the regular local planning and budgeting process - as well as access
services/assets/grants from service delivery agencies, NGOs or other donor-funded programmes.
The social mobilisation methods will ensure social inclusion to enable citizens from
marginalised/disadvantaged groups to participate in public affairs – be it by interacting with local
government or with public services and other agencies. Addressing the structural causes of inequality
and exclusion requires both changes in the formal rules by which local governments and services
operate and – the more challenging -- transformation in people’s attitudes and behaviour. This may
require “targeted” SM and this will be adopted by the LGCDP. At the same time LGCDP will ensured
that this targeted SM approach does not result in the exclusion/alienation of better-off or more
privileged members of the wider community, who may become resentful or obstructive.
This SM intervention will also focus on the wider capacity of communities and marginalised groups to
articulate their needs and priorities and to exercise their rights in regard to local government and
administration. This will be undertaken by support to a range of activities: giving such communities,
where clearly possible, resources and technical support to be able to fund their development priorities
or pool with others, the rights to prioritize their needs and/or methods of how they wish to attain their
developmental outcomes, information and awareness campaigns on local governance issues, using
innovative and non-conventional approaches; dissemination of local government plans, budgets,
expenditures, etc; support to social audits, public hearings, etc; training and support to the local and
national media to ensure more informed and active reporting of local governance issues; support to
public expenditure tracking surveys and the dissemination of findings. Once the interim local
governments are established, a key activity will also be in training and guiding these bodies in the
basics of responsible local governance and local government-community relations.
3.3.2  Local  bodies  top­up  block  grants  for  community  led  local  development 
(DDC, Municipality and VDC) 
This component will aim to ensure two particular outcomes: (a) not only strengthening the ability of local
government to respond and to deliver the public and collective goods and services which they are
mandated to provide but also (b) again, where conditions permit, giving local governments an
opportunity to utilize a portion of the top-up block grants to experiment with innovative and flexible
methods to attain the Programme outcome.4 A cardinal principle underlying this component will be that
all public funding for such goods and services will be channelled through local government and be
allocated locally on the basis of bottom-up planning and budgeting processes. LGCDP will provide
support both to improving these funding mechanisms and to improving local government planning,
budgeting and overall management, within the statutory frameworks.

4

As before, the decision making process on which local government body has access to how much resources to
experiment with how to attain the developmental outcome will be ascertained.

20

Funding will be allocated to allow a substantial increase in the current annual grant support to local
governments nation-wide, to augment funding available for such goods and services, and also to
introduce incentives for better local performance and compliance with agreed governance standards
(through modified MC/PM system). These general, unconditional grant funds will be open for local
government expenditure on the “menu” of public goods and services mandated by the LSGA to that
particular level of government.
Special attention will be paid to phasing-in this mechanism at VDC level, and to using it also to leverage
better management of the existing block grant allocations. Top-up grants will be blended together with
the GON block grant and will be provided in the form of capacity development grants and development
grants. Support will also be provided to allow GON to move towards more equitable formula-based
allocations, which pay due regard to differing fiscal potential and poverty levels of different areas.
In regard to municipalities, prior to roll-out of topped up block grants for the smaller less resource
endowed (non-metropolitan) municipalities and the use of the MC/PM system, a thorough review of the
entire system will be conducted, including a review of the type of grants to be included and the options
for reforms of some of these grants. It is important that the performance-based grants are of sufficient
size to ensure strong incentives for improved performance.
For metropolitan, sub-metropolitan, and larger and fiscally stronger municipalities the overall system of
finance (own source revenues, taxes, user fees, borrowing etc.) will be reviewed and reforms supported
from the Programme.
This general grant mechanism will be complemented by one or more targeted, conditional or earmarked
grant mechanisms – the programme will pay special attention to developing mechanisms for safety net
or social protection funding arrangements, which target disadvantaged and marginalised groups. Here,
too, the Program will consider whether an innovative method exists to ensure that resource allocations
are subject to revealed preferences of the recipients.
In addition, there will be a focus on improving local tax revenue administration, and render this in a
more transparent way, since this will be a key ingredient in the emergence of accountable local
government bodies in the future, once local councils are back in place.
3.3.3   Capacity development of local governments for effective service delivery 
LGCDP will pay attention to capacity building and procedures of local governments at all levels, and
their financing arrangements, to promote more effective delivery of basic infrastructure and services
(“meso-level” or “supply”). The principles underlying these activities are that the focus will be on rolling
out and also improving GON’s statutory procedures and regulations, that additional personnel will be
kept to a strict minimum and that where possible demand-driven mechanisms should be used. It is
envisaged that these activities will therefore consist of:
• “supply-driven” training and awareness raising of the different types of personnel in the different
levels of local government, through the roll-out of standard packages and curricula;
• more “demand-driven” mechanisms whereby local governments may use capacity development
grants to buy-in specific types of support from pre-certified training agencies (which will also be
brought to standard through the programme);
• a variation on the demand-driven approach, whereby local governments may use a (small) part
of the enhanced grants to contract-in specific technical support to help implement their
21

investment and service delivery programmes. This will be especially important at VDC level –
VDCs will be encouraged to cooperate to use these funds to engage overseers, other
technicians, accounting staff, etc, on short/long term basis;
• Support to DDCs to enable them to better monitor and support VDCs; etc.
A final but strategically critical element in this intervention will be the testing of refinements and
improvements to specific procedures and institutional arrangements (consistent with the overall
statutory framework) for national roll-out. Examples of such areas are: bottom-up planning and
budgeting; DDC– line agencies coordination in planning and delivery; conditional grants to promote
sector devolution; and targeted safety net or social protection mechanisms. Such testing would be
undertaken on a limited scale for one or two years and – once results have been analysed and policymakers are in agreement with the innovations – these would then be rolled out nationally.
3.3.4   Policy support for decentralisation and local governance (devolution, fiscal 
decentralisation,  human  resources  development  for  policy  making,  action 
research etc.) 
The intervention aims to address the development of an enabling policy, regulatory and support
framework for devolution, local governance and community development including the policy
implementation capacities of MLD and other national bodies (“macro-level”). There will be two elements
to this:
• Support will be provided for improvements in the policy and regulatory framework, to promote
sector devolution and fiscal decentralisation (by clarifying functions and expenditure
assignments of local governments, and developing a more appropriate architecture for centrelocal transfers, etc), more effective local government staffing arrangements, a more robust
framework for gender and social inclusion, etc. In the interim period, this will be based on the
LSGA framework, but as and when new policy and legislation emerges the focus will be on
adaptation to the new context as well.
• Support will also be provided for central government and other national institutions to play their
due support and mentoring functions in regard to local government: development of standard
operating procedures, training manuals, and core curricula for different categories of local
government and personnel; build-up of national/regional lists of pre-qualified public and private
training agencies; enhancement of MLD’s ability to formulate policy and procedures in key
areas, to monitor local government performance, to support, mentor and communicate with
these bodies, and to coordinate with other key ministries; roll-out of, and regular adjustment to,
the MC/PM methodology; support to Office of Auditor General; etc.
Throughout, activities under this component will be governed by two considerations: avoidance of preempting any major future policy option in regard to the shape of the sub-national government; but – at
the same time - rapid adjustment to any such policy changes which emerge from the newly elected
government during the programme period.
However, given the uncertainties surrounding policy on decentralisation and local government, LGCDP
will have modest policy ambitions. Policy-level “fine-tuning” will largely concern "small" policy – systems
and procedures, ways of doing business, and the like, building on and consistent with the statutory
framework of the LSGA. What is vital for LGCDP is to keep local government "on the map" whilst major
policy processes are ongoing.

22

3.4 

Programme objective 

3.4.1  Goal 
LGCDP's over-arching goal will be to contribute towards poverty reduction through inclusive
responsive and accountable local governance and participatory community-led development
that will ensure increased involvement of women, Dalits, Adibasi Janajatis, Muslims, Madhesis,
disadvantaged groups in the local governance process. Ultimately, then, LGCDP will be judged by the
extent to which it delivers real and tangible benefits to the poor and to citizens as a whole.
3.4.2  Purpose 
The Purpose of the Programme will be “Improved access to locally and inclusively prioritised public
goods and services”. This will be achieved through both supply and demand side intervention –
specifically, through integrating mechanisms for the exercise of shared community decision rights over
the block grant allocations for service delivery and clear community oversight responsibilities into the
local government system. The programme will contribute to the overall state-restructuring process by
making the state at the local level more accountable to people in respect to the allocation of
discretionary fiscal resources, increased block grants and own-source revenues. The public finance
aspects of local government will be integrated with community participation and community led
initiatives to create state-citizen interface for nation building.
3.4.3  Outcomes 
The programme will contribute towards attaining the goal through achieving its three major Programme
Outcomes (each of which effectively constitutes a programme component) i.e.
(1) citizens and communities empowered;
(a) to exercise their voice to a large degree than currently exist
(b) to engage actively with local governments and local government resource allocation,
decision making and
(c) Accounting processes structured to enable greater citizen-community input and
oversight;
(2) Increased capacity of local governments to manage resources and deliver basic services in an
inclusive and equitable manner; and
(3) Strengthened policy and national institutional framework for decentralisation, devolution and
community development.
LGCDP will be a national programme of support for decentralisation, local governance, and community
development with the intent of working throughout the country and at all levels of the local
governments.
To achieve its programme outcomes LGCDP will focus on four strategic areas:
• Ensuring active and effective participation by communities in the local development processes
and strong interface with their local governments, in order to better articulate community voice
and to hold their local governments to account for the services and resources that they are
supposed to deliver, and communities empowered to fulfil this role.
• Building the capacities and procedures of local bodies, and their financing arrangements, to
promote more effective delivery of basic infrastructure and services. Programme funds will be
23

used as leverage, but activities would be deliberately designed so as to apply to the use and
management of all fiscal resources of the local bodies and not just those provided by donors.
This area of activity also (and necessarily) includes working at the national level, in order to
ensure as enabling a policy and institutional environment as possible.
• Assisting in the development of the overall policy and enabling regulatory framework for
devolution and local governance, community development, social empowerment and safety net.
Policies for empowering socially and economically marginalised groups/families while also will
be strengthened, as well as building the capacity of MLD and other national agencies to play
their appropriate supportive and supervisory role for local governments. Establishing the
preconditions for harmonised donor support for local government and following SWAp.
• Institutional mechanism for downward accountability: The programme will explicitly seek to
strengthen formal upward and downward accountability mechanisms. As elected
representatives are not in place in the local bodies, alternative institutional mechanisms for
downward accountability are needed to ensure that decision rights are vested in all sections of
the community, assuring quality control of Social Mobilisers, and implementing social
accountability mechanisms. At the same time activities will be aimed at ensuring the capacity of
communities to not only hold decision makers accountable but also act on their development
prioritization. Basic tools (e.g. public hearings, public audits, social audits, hoarding boards,
publication of annual plan budget and expenditure and mechanisms to report corruption and
misappropriation of goods and funds, etc.) will be used for this purpose.

3.5 

Results Framework 

This section provides a brief narrative description of the programme’s structure, its three main
components and associated outputs and indicative activities (see Annex 2 – Logical Framework). It
should be noted that each of the three programme components will be further elaborated upon through
the development of detailed implementation and operational guidelines – which will define precise
implementation modalities.
Component 1: Citizens and communities engaged actively with local governments 
and hold them accountable 
This component of LGCDP aims to promote the capacities of communities, and especially the more
disadvantaged groups and those in more remote rural areas, urban pockets to articulate their needs
and priorities and to make their claims on local government and resources – in other words, to promote
more effective “demand” and voice. Activities under this component are explicitly intended to ensure
that communities and community organisations are able to access these resources and use them in
ways that are consistent with local needs and priorities.
Social mobilisation activities will enable/empower communities and community organisations to engage
in the local level bottom-up planning process (as provided for by LSGA – see annex 4) in order to
ensure that they access the public resources and services that they require and need on a priority
basis,
There are two outputs that LGCDP will be expected to deliver under this component.

24

Output 1.  

Communities  and  community  organisations  participate  actively  in  local 
governance processes 

Output 1 activities will aim at enabling communities and community-based organisations to interact with
local governments (largely, but not exclusively, with VDCs). This will include active participation in the
planning/budgeting process, and in the decisions about implementation, and oversight of local
government actions and activities. Local governments will keep open channels of communication and
foster dialogue with various sections of the population (women, youth, and marginalized groups) and
insure clear decision making rights in the prioritization of projects and allocation of block grant funds.
For this output, indicative activities are as follows:
1.1

Establish institutional mechanisms through which communities and community
organisations can participate in the local planning, implementation and oversight
process

This activity will link up – in a tangible form – its “demand” and “supply” components. What is envisaged
here is the establishment of a structure in each DDC and VDC, which can ensure the participation of
representative members of the community in local planning, implementation and oversight processes.
The structure should serve as a forum for discussion on the priorities of different sections of the
community for the use of block grants between themselves and with the VDC/DDC and the local
representatives of political parties. As a minimum condition the structure should be tasked with making
decisions on the prioritisation of activities and allocation of resources within the annual VDC/DDC plan,
selection of CBOs and/or private service providers to undertake implementation, monitoring and quality
control of the projects financed and implemented under the plan and reporting on implementation
through the MC/PM system.5
The exact way in which such a structure could be established and function will need to be subject to
further studies in the inception phase of the programme, taking into account the different experiences
from Nepal as well as legislation and practices for decision making in local governance as outlined in
the Local Self Governance Act. In particular, the question of how to select community members to
participate in the structure with a view to ensuring that they are representative of the entire community,
in particular marginalised groups, will need to be considered carefully. There are likely to be different
ways such a structure could be established and in different parts of the country it would probably work
in different ways. The programme should not take too rigid an approach to what the structure looks like,
as long as it makes sure that a mechanism is in place in all DDCs/VDCs that meets the minimum
conditions outlined above.
Key decision points in resource allocations are in the councils and committees at local level. The
programme will put in place rules and procedures to ensure that the views of the community cannot be
circumvented in the decision making process.
Steps in establishment of the structure at the local level could include:
• Strengthening community representation in District, Village and Municipal Councils – in the
absence of elected committee members - ensure that in addition to the all party mechanism
and the DDC/VDC and municipal officials, all sections of the community are represented in
5

This, however, the portion of the top-up grants that could be available based upon prioritized projects for
communities to have more access to resources, procedures to be established inthe inception phase.

25

village council decision making within the areas defined in the Local Self Governance Act,
including final approval of plans and budgets.
• At DDC level strengthening of the Integrated Plan Formulation Committee (IPFC) provided for
in the Local Self Governance Act to include community representatives, proper representation
of disadvantaged groups and political parties and at the VDC and municipal level formation of
similar planning committees, which will work with the Village and municipality Development
Committees to execute their duties as these are defined in the Local Self Governance Act,
including the preparation of plans and budgets.
Sub-activities will thus include:
• Map out modalities and experiences from various countries in participatory planning procedures
including relevance experiences, if any from within Nepal.
• Devise modalities for appropriate solutions in a Nepal context. preclude
• Draw up plans for the implementation of selected mechanisms.
• Support the functioning of mechanisms, when established, particularly with respect to
safeguarding the participation of community members and disadvantaged groups.
• Organise wider consultation including budget meetings in which community members can
participate;
• Promote the use of secret ballot when projects are prioritized and resources are allocated to
insure that weaker members of the decision making forum are not intimidated in the exercise of
their choice.
• Institute more robust disclosure requirements for local governments (budgets, tenders, reports
etc. posted on public notice boards and use of other means).
• Improving scheme implementation and procurement procedures, to provide opportunities for
local citizens to be involved in both implementing schemes and in overseeing their completion
through social audit processes (by, for example, encouraging inclusively formed VDC level
community/user groups to be recognised by the LBs to function as formal ‘User Committees”
for implementation).
1.2

Strengthen the capacity of communities and community organisations to participate in
the local planning, implementation and oversight process

This activity serves to provide a purpose for social mobilisation, which should be seen as contributing to
improving the quality of local governance and local governance processes – by (a) facilitating
community participation in local government planning and budgeting; (b) making downward
accountability more robust and effective through active community engagement with local government;
and (c) increasing community involvement in priotization, implementation and oversight of service
delivery activities. Seen this way, social mobilisation is a means to an end, rather than end in itself –
firmly anchored in local governance processes and oriented towards helping communities and
community organisations to interface with local governments and other service delivery agencies (e.g.
health centres, NGOs, etc.) at the local level.
Sub-activities will thus include:
• Develop a strategy for SM within areas a, b and c outlined above
• As part of the above mentioned strategy, develop special criteria and modalities for mobilisation
and inclusion of disadvantaged groups (DAGs).
• Map out DDC/VDCs according to degree of mobilisation already in place and define modality
for the coverage of social mobilisation activities
26

• Establish criteria for choosing VDCs for roll out
• Conduct social mobilisation with community organisations – method depending on the level of
maturity of the local area with training in community mobilisation and principles of local
community participation.6
• Prepare implementation framework and exit strategies for LGCDP SM activities.
Output 2.  

Increased  capacity  of  citizens,  communities  and  marginalized  groups  to 
assert their rights and hold local governments accountable. 

This output will ensure that the general public becomes more aware of local governance issues and
processes. In addition, the programme will work towards providing communities with more meaningful
opportunities to access resources for own determined priorities and to hold their local governments to
account for their performance (in terms of effectively and efficiently satisfying local needs and priorities)
including rights-based perspective.
Three sets of indicative activities will enable the programme to deliver this output.
2.1

Carry out information, education and communication (IEC) activities

Here, the programme will focus on providing the general public with access to basic information about
the local government system. In addition, IEC activities will ensure that citizens are provided with
accurate and timely information on core local governance issues – institutional arrangements (LSGA
and related regulations), citizen charters, service delivery responsibilities, human rights vis-à-vis local
governments, local government budgets and budget allocations, revenues, local government
expenditures, audit outcomes, the outcomes of MC/PM assessments, the specific rights of women,
children, the youth, and DAG etc. Important GE/SI and CY sensitive issues will be considered in both
the choice of messages, materials, and the way they are delivered (languages, audio/print media etc.).
This activity will be out-sourced to a media consulting firm or other capable public/private undertakings
through a competitive bidding process to manage on a day-to-day basis, under the supervision of the
documentation, information and publications section of MLD. The process will be defined by the
LGCDP PCU in its regular work-planning process and submitted to the programme’s
Consultative/Advisory Committee for endorsement. Sub-activities will therefore include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Identify core IEC messages to be disseminated (as per the requirements of the communities)
Identify and contract key media for IEC activities
Disseminate basic messages about LG (LSGA, decentralisation policies, etc.)
Provide basic information to the public (block grants, audit outcomes, MC/PM assessments,
public expenditure tracking system etc.)
Support MLD to perform the activities on IEC
Support (training and information) to media on local governance issues
Criteria based funds allocation system as per expenditure assignments;
Local communities have clear stakes for responsibilities assigned to and for them;

(Some VDCs already have functioning community organizations that network most of the community organizations that
exist for specific purposes or to serve specific groups and provide a forum for discussion and identification of collective
priorities; other VDCs have many individual special purpose groups but there is a need to bring them together; still other
VDCs have very few or no community organizations and have not been “mobilized” by external agents – though of course
they do have their traditional social structures. The type of training and mobilization efforts needed in these different
situations need to be thought through )

2.2

Annual, external, financial audits of local governments;
Improved regular reporting and follow-up on the results;
MC/PM assessments7;
Social audit, public audit, public hearing processes;
Information dissemination campaigns, aimed at providing the public with information about local
government affairs, block grant allocations and other aspects of LGCDP.
Strengthen mechanisms for local and community level advocacy, monitoring and
oversight of local governance issues

The programme design recognises that it will be necessary to go simultaneously with social
mobilisation and core IEC activities in order to foster more meaningful interaction between citizens and
civil society, on the one hand, and local governments, on the other. Increasing the breadth and depth of
accountability mechanisms for local governments is seen as being a vital way of ensuring that
increased fiscal transfers are properly and effectively managed by local governments. To do this the
programme will support the use of a range of mechanisms through which local citizens can hold their
local governments accountable
Support will be provided through the establishment of a semi-autonomous Local Governance and
Accountability Facility (LG&AF) which will be able to finance a range of activities, including information
to and interactions within communities and between communities and local governments on corruption
problems, promotion of social audits, support to community vigilance groups and support to local media
for critical and informed coverage of local governance issues. Given the critical nature of this type of
activities work plan will be prepared by a semi autonomous facility, with a separate board with
participation of MLD, donors and independent civil society representatives. The design of modalities
and guidelines for the facility will be made during the inception phase.8
2.3

Provide technical and capacity building support to citizens' institutions led by
disadvantaged groups to promote interactions with LBs

The programme will – in addition to the general capacity building support to community organisations
under output 1.2 - provide special support to disadvantaged groups and organisations representing
them, in order to strengthen their (a) interaction with - and voice in - local government, and (b) ability to
set own priorities and attain resources to fund them. This activity will also strengthen and support the
existing district level coordination committees of dalits, janajatis and women. It will ensure that capacity
building support to the COs led by disadvantaged communities are not left out. Further specification of
these activities will be undertaken in the inception period. The sub-activities will include the following:
• Identify COs (including DDC-level dalit, janajati and other committees) led by disadvantaged
communities
• Assess need of such COs’
• Fine tune mandate of COs
7

MCPM provide numerous safeguards, and for which the outcomes are made publicly available – this tool will promote a dialogue on the
LB performance and ways and means to strengthen this weaker areas
8
Sub-activities for semi-autonomous Local Governance and Accountability Facility (LG&AF) may include: management arrangements,
establish local governance and accountability facility, organizing and supporting social audits, support to civil society groups and public
vigilance agencies, supporting CSOs/CBOs to organizations and media etc. and establishing mechanisms for disseminating information
about good local government practices, producing citizen report cards;

28

• Provide support for training on local governance issues
• Provide technical assistance and advisory services to such COs including advocacy for civil
rights
• Provide support for appropriate institutional setup and legal landing mechanisms
Component 2: Increased capacity of local governments to manage resources and 
deliver basic services in an inclusive and equitable manner. 
Component 2 recognises that whilst making the “demand” side of local governance more effective
(through Component 1), little will be achieved unless the “supply” side is also strengthened – to
effectively meet the increased demands articulated by and heightened expectations of local
communities and citizens. Local governments (DDCs, VDCs and municipalities) need to build up their
capacities to respond appropriately and effectively to expressed priorities and needs. For this to
happen, the programme will deliver three outputs.
Output 3.  

Local governments gain access to greater fiscal resources in equitable and 
appropriate ways 

Increased block grant transfers to DDCs, municipalities and VDCs will enable local governments to
deliver more public goods and services and respond more effectively to citizens’ needs and priorities.
Increased block grant transfers will also act as a fiscal incentive for empowerment, providing local
citizens with more reasons to participate in local governance because more resources will be at stake.
The minimum conditions (MC) and performance measures (PM) linked to the development grants will
promote better performance in core areas such as planning, financial management and good
governance/transparency. There is one output that LGCDP will be expected to deliver under this
component.
Through this output, the programme will significantly increase the size of fiscal transfers made to local
governments – thereby enabling DDCs, VDCs and municipalities to finance the production of more local
public goods and services. Importantly, this will be done on the basis of performance (as measured
through MC/PM assessments). On a more selective basis, LGCDP will also seek to improve local ownsource revenue collection.
(i)

The roll-out and uptake strategy9 for block grants will be :
• DDCs (75) as the necessary systems and procedures are more or less in place.
• VDCs (roll out from year one – with inclusion on basis of a set of simple MCs and poverty
targeting). In Year one, topping up of VDC grants will be done in around 900 VDCs based on a
screening of minimum conditions and DAG mapping criteria (see Annex 1). In the following
years 2000 VDCs will be targeted in FY 2009/10, 3000 VDCs in FY 2010/11 and all eligible
VDCs in FY 2011/12. More detailed piloting of systems for VDC block grants will be carried out
in a smaller number of VDCs (50).
• Municipalities: Roll out from year two. Prior to roll-out of topped up block grants for the smaller
(non-metropolitan) municipalities10 and the use of the MC/PM system, a thorough review of the
entire system will be conducted, including a review of the type of grants to be included and the

9

Detailed strategy of the expanded block grants will be developed during the inception period
Municipalities with less resources have been categorized by MLD on the basis of - i) rural characteristics, ii)
less resources, iii) smaller population, and iv) small number of enterprises in the municipalities but further
review of the eligible municipalities will be conducted in year one.

10

29

options for reforms of some of these grants. It will be assessed that the performance-based
grants are of sufficient size to ensure strong incentives for improved performance. In year two,
topping up of municipal grants will be done gradually starting with some municipalities in FY
2009/10 with a gradual expansion over the following years.
• For larger metropolitan and sub-metropolitan municipalities, the overall system of finance (own
source revenues, taxes, user fees, borrowing etc.) will be reviewed and reforms supported from
the Programme.
(ii)

Investment menus for the topping-up will follow those applicable to GON’s development grants
(block grants), allowing for a certain percentage (up to 7% of the total top-up) to be used for
covering investment in servicing costs. Concerning the DDC grants, this investment servicing
part will also cover an amount (2%) for support to the VDCs in areas such as preparation,
planning, accountability and reporting. VDCs and municipalities can spend up to 5% of their
expanded block grants on investment servicing costs. The investment menu in the
development grants will be reviewed and defined in order to ensure that the investments made
by each tier of the LB system, are in accordance with the principles of subsidiary and the
expenditure assignments across tiers of the LB system and targeted towards service delivery
and infrastructure improvements.

(iii)

The budgetary consequences of the topping up of the grants will be estimated (depending on
final decisions about roll-out and uptake), and on the basis of expected levels of compliance
with the minimum conditions for access to grants.

(iv)

Allocation criteria for block grants (largely population-based with additional criteria for cost
differentials and poverty targeting) will be elaborated. There is a need to keep allocation
formula simple. The existing formula for DDCs can easily be improved by modifying the
application and weighting of the existing criteria applied (particularly for HDI and the cost
index).

(v)

Funds from GON and development partners’ will be merged and transferred to LBs as one
common allocation.

(vi)

The application of the MC/PMs will be defined. The blended grants will contain a minimum
eligible allocation for each LB (e.g. about 20-30 % of the total blended development block
grant) and that the remaining amount (the largest share) be allocated in accordance with the
results of the MC/PM system. This will ensure that robust incentives remain in place, at the
same time as ensuring a minimum level of activities within each LB.

(vii)

Preparations for the topping up of VDC block grants will be started as soon as possible. Based
on the results of the planned studies by MLD, piloting of MCs will be conducted in year one and
then scaled up from year two onwards. An assessment system will be designed, based on a
DDC-managed review process with some kind of support and quality assurance from the
national assessment of DDCs.

Several sets of indicative activities will enable the programme to deliver this output.
3.1

Provide formula and performance based (MC/PM) block grants to DDCs

DDC capital grants will be calculated on the basis of a simple (criteria) formula, made available to
DDCs subject to compliance with Minimum Conditions (MCs) and calibrated in accordance with annual
30

performance (as determined by PMs). Such top-up grants and their use will be determined through a
participatory planning process.
Sub-activities include:
• Revise grant formula and guidelines, define investment menu and improve reporting systems
and formats
• Put in order /refine DDC block grant formula
• Disburse DDC block grants
3.2

Provide formula and performance based (MC) block grants to VDCs

VDC capital grants will be based on similar principles to those underlying DDC grants. VDCs will
become eligible for capital grants subject to their demonstrating compliance with a simple set of MCs, to
be developed through piloting. Again, their use would be largely discretionary and determined through a
bottom-up planning process. Sub-activities will include:
• Select the first batch of VDCs for the gradual roll-out of block grants, based on objective criteria
such as poverty and absorption capacity/minimum capacity to handle funds
• Review/up-date the VDC block grant guidelines
• Put in order VDC block grant formula
• Prepare and pilot MC/PM
• Disburse VDC block grants – gradual phasing in
3.3

Provide formula and performance based (MC/PM) block grants to non metropolitan
municipalities

Smaller/less fiscally endowed municipalities will receive capital block grants from LGCDP. Such
LGCDP-funded municipal grants will be consistent with any financing procedures developed by MLD.
Sub-activities will include:
•
•
•
•
•
3.4

Define the municipal grant system for block grant formula (application and size)
Elaborate block grant guidelines
Elaborate municipal block grant formula
Refine and implement MC/PM system
Disburse municipal block grants
Support to development of the metropolitan, sub-metropolitan and larger municipalities
funding system

Metropolitan and sub-metropolitan municipalities will receive reforms support from the Programme
based on their overall system of finance (own source revenues, taxes, user fees, borrowing etc.). Subactivities will include:
• Review and recommend the funding system for metropolitan and sub-metropolitan
municipalities
• Implement recommendations to improve on the overall system of funding including systems for
improved performance incentives

31

3.5

Assess MC/PM of all supported local governments

A key principle underlying programme’s financing of local governments is that access to top-up grants
should be contingent upon their performance (as measured through MC/PM assessments)11. Subactivities for all of this will include:
•
•
•
•
•

Design MC/PM assessment process for VDCs and finalise the municipal tool
Train DDCs in use of VDC MC/PM assessment methodology
Develop systems of quality assurance and approval of results
Provide DDCs with financial and logistical support to carry out VDC MC/PM assessments
Provide MLD/LBFC with support to contract out MC/PM assessments for DDCs and
municipalities and QA of the VDC assessments
• Provide MLD/LBFC with current support to up-date and refine the system (linked to output 6)

3.6

Provide support for own source revenue collection by LGs

In order to provide local governments with a limited degree of fiscal autonomy, the programme will (on a
selective basis) support own-source revenue collection by DDCs, municipalities and VDCs. This
support will include the following sub-activities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
3.7

Assess existing tax/revenue base for LGs
Assess LG revenue administration procedures
Identify ways of expanding LG tax/revenue base - tax potential studies
Identify options for improving LG tax/revenue administration
Fine tune LG revenue collection/administration manuals
Establish improved linkage between revenue and service delivery
Provide training to LG officials and elected/nominated representatives
Review and refine revenue & expenditure assignments and types of revenue

Revenue and expenditure assignments and types of revenues at the LBs will be reviewed by the
programme through the LBFC. Sub-activities will include:
• Review revenue and expenditure sharing arrangements
• Review appropriateness of existing types of revenue (e.g. LDF, house and property tax)
• Support implementation of any proposed reforms to revenue/expenditure sharing arrangements
and types of revenues
Output 4.  

Appropriate  capacity  building  services  passed  on  to  all  levels  of  the  local 
government service delivery system 

In the case of DDCs and municipalities, basic MC/PM methodologies have already been developed – and LGCDP will
simply assist the LBFC in their application. For VDCs, however, MC/PM methodology is currently not in place and will
therefore need to be developed (simplified MC/PM). Given the relatively large number of VDCs in Nepal, simple and easy to
use performance assessment method will be administered by DDCs (rather than by consultants contracted by the Ministry)
combined with certain QA from the national assessment teams conducted the DDC/Municipal assessments. The entire set
of MC/PM indicators will be revisited to better incorporate GE/SI concerns and thus provide greater incentives for their
mainstreaming into local government processes.
11

32

Whilst access to more fiscal resources will undoubtedly strengthen the capacity of local governments to
respond to priorities and needs, developing systemic and human capacities will also be required. The
programme will deliver such capacity building in a variety of ways. This will also allow for the inclusion
of capacity building for implementation/production functions, many of which will be fulfilled by agencies
(e.g. user groups, community organisations, and private sector contractors) which are not a part of the
local government system per se.
This output of the LGCDP will be important in regard to:
• a core, supply-driven, component through which (a) all LGs are provided with training in the
basics and (b) general purpose systems and procedures are developed and disseminated in
the form of user-friendly manuals;
• a demand-driven component through which DDCs and municipalities formulate their own
capacity development plans (CDPs) and finance their implementation out of annual capacity
development grants (CDGs) – out-sourcing to pre-certified capacity development service
providers; and
• A DDC-led system of support, regular backstopping and mentoring for VDCs.
This output will enable local bodies to establish the important linkages between: i) development grants;
ii) the incentives (rewards and sanctions, assessment systems); and iii) the LBs’ ability to address the
identified functional gaps and weaknesses in an equitable manner.
Several sets of indicative activities will enable the programme to deliver this output.
4.1

Design and allocate CD grants for LGs

In the medium term, LGCDP aims to strengthen the extent to which local government capacity building
becomes demand-driven. Part of this will include providing local governments (initially DDCs) with
capacity development grants, with which they will be able to purchase the specific CD services that they
require.
LGCDP’s Capacity Development Grants (CDG) to local governments will be rolled out as soon as
possible to DDCs and then to municipalities. The CD grants should kick in from year two of the
programme, as it will take some time to prepare for this new demand driven modality. CDGs will be
independent of the top-up block grants and will be calculated on the basis of a transparent and
appropriate formula that divides up a total annual CD funding pool. A menu of eligible expenditures
(and related rules) will be drawn up, setting ceilings on certain expenditure items (e.g. equipment,
training, study tours, etc.). With respect to VDCs, CDGs may not be appropriate in the short term given
that the capacity of the VDCs to handle this type of grant may take more time to prepare for. In the
short term, then, the DDCs should ensure coverage of VDC capacity development needs out of the
DDC CDGs.
Sub-activities will consist of the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Prepare formula for CD grants
Define the eligible expenditures to be covered by the grants
Inform LGs of CD grant system
Disburse CD grants to LGs
Monitor the utilisation of the grants and adjust (on an annual basis)
33

4.2

Earmark LGs’ access to TA funds (embedded in block grants)

Through LGCDP, local governments will be able to use a percentage of their top-up grants to procure
specialised technical assistance (e.g. consultant, engineer, technicians etc.). The proportion of block
grants that can be used by local governments for purposes of procuring technical assistance and
investment servicing costs should not exceed 7% for DDCs (of which 2% goes for mentoring /
monitoring of VDCs), 5% for VDCs and municipalities of the total value of the block grant. However, and
depending on the extent to which block grants are weighted by population size, a “floor” allocation for
investment servicing costs will be introduced in order to avoid inadequate allocations for
demographically small LGs. In addition, LGs will directly procure such TA and/or investments services –
and not hire additional permanent staff. Sub-activities will include:
• Elaborate capacity building block grant strategy and implementation arrangements
• Communicate to DDCs, VDCs and municipalities on the size of the block grants earmarked for
TA
4.3

Provide support to DDCs for backstopping and mentoring of VDCs

Given the level of fiscal resources that will be made available to VDCs (through both regular
Government block grants and LGCDP top-up grants), and the increased demands that will therefore be
placed on VDCs to properly manage those resources, the programme will develop procedures and
subsequently support DDC backstopping and mentoring of VDCs. In this respect, DDCs will probably
need to provide VDCs with backstopping in areas such as financial management, planning,
implementation, etc.
DDCs will establish task teams for this, constituted on an as-needed and subject-wise basis. For
example, if VDCs require backstopping for financial management, then it would be best that DDC
accounts office staff provides this. According to guidelines, approximately 2 % of the block grants for
the DDC can be used for backstopping support to the VDCs in areas such as planning, appraisal,
reporting and accountability (funded from the investment service costs above). However, within the
DDC one unit will assume overall responsibility for coordinating task – i.e. this task could be assigned to
DDC Human Resource Development Unit. The LGCDP should further explore these options as part of
the implementation arrangements.
Sub-activities will include:
• Prepare guidelines for DDC backstopping and mentoring of VDCs
• Disseminate guidelines to DDCs and VDCs
• Build a facilitating team within DDC including line agencies’ officials if needed/necessary, using
contracted NGOs/companies to support the teams in up-start phase.
• Train DDCs in backstopping and mentoring of VDCs

34

4.4

Prepare LGs GE/SI Capacity Development (CD) plan

In order to promote an increasingly demand-driven approach to capacity development, the programme
will introduce a simple capacity development planning methodology to local governments. This will start
with DDCs and municipalities, but will eventually include VDCs as well.
DDCs and municipalities will draw up capacity development plans, based on simple and largely selfadministered needs assessments – linked explicitly to the outcomes of their respective MC/PM
assessments. Responsibility for this will be assigned to DDC and municipal HR Development Units,
which (on the basis of consultations) would draw up CD plans and submit them to advisory committees
and councils for approval. Such CD plans will define the demand-driven dimension to local government
capacity development.
Sub-activities will consist of:
•
•
•
•
•
4.5

Provide support to develop a CD planning methodology for LGs
Support the HR Development Units in the DDCs to develop CD plans and use the CD grants
Provide Training in LG CD planning processes
Provide support to the HR unit of the DDCs and municipality and VDC CD functions
Backstop LG CD planning activities
Provide GE/SI core training services to LGs

This activity will support to design a core, supply-driven, capacity development programme for local
governments. This will be rolled out across the country, using (wherever possible) qualified service
providers as trainers.
Core training services will be defined, procured and monitored/supervised by MLD as part of its overall
National Capacity Development Strategy for local governments (see LGCDP outputs 6 and 7). Core
training will cover the “mandatory” CD menu for all LGs – and would constitute the supply-driven
dimension to local government capacity development, and will encompasses areas where all (or most)
LBs have special problems, which are likely to impact negatively on the implementation or increase
fiduciary risks, such as financial management and procurement. A number of core standard training
modules will be elaborated within generic administrative areas such as planning, budgeting, financial
management, procurement and good governance and the programme. This initiative will be supported
through MLD.
Sub-activities will include:
• Contract core CD service providers
• Supervise activities of CD service providers
• Monitor and evaluate performance of CD service providers
4.6

Provide core capacity-building to local level line departments to deliver public services

This activity will support to design a core capacity development programme for local line departments to
deliver public services. It will help building capacity of other potential actors at the local level. Subactivities will include:
35

•
•
•
•
4.7

Review interactions between line-departments and core administration at the DDC level
Elaborate training materials on these issues
Support line departments (HR, etc.)
Provide standard training for all DDCs and VDC secretaries
Provide core training services to community organisations, user groups and other local
service delivery (production) agencies (including private /SME sector)

User groups, community organisations and the private sector will also be involved in the “production” of
public goods and services. This activity will strengthen their capacity in service delivery at local level.
Sub-activities will include:
• Elaborate training materials on various forms of service delivery production (planning,
budgeting, implementation, M&E etc.) for COs, user groups and private contractors
• Support training of these providers (contracted NGOs and private companies
4.8

Design standard training modules for the demand side training

Standard training curricula will be prepared to provide training to the service providers at local level
including certification process. Sub-activities will include:
• Prepare core training curricula
• Define certification process for service providers
4.9.

Capacity building of Interim Local Bodies and officials

LGCDP will provide Interim Local Bodies and officials with appropriate capacity building in order to
strengthen their ability to provide adequate oversight.
Output 5. Local governments service delivery mechanisms and processes fine­tuned 

Although LGCDP constitutes a national programme, the programme will nonetheless retain a capacity
to fine-tune a range of systems, procedures and processes – with a view to having such pilots scaled
up at a later date.
To implement pilot activities, LGCDP will establish special implementation and monitoring
arrangements, inter alia:
•
•

A small and dedicated field team, responsible for establishing, supporting and monitoring pilots.
This sub-team of LGCDP will closely coordinate its activities with MLD and any LGCDP
technical advisers; and
A coherent geographical zone of intervention for all pilot activities (for example, six Districts in a
single Region) so as to minimise costs associated with intensive support, supervision and
monitoring.

A basic LB reporting system for physical progress reports will be elaborated during the Approach
Period.
Fine-tuning and piloting will be undertaken in a number of areas, as described in the set of indicative
activities below.
36

5.1

Update PEM and PFM systems and procedures

Whilst LSGA and its related regulations do provide a relatively comprehensive framework for local level
planning and public expenditure and financial management, there are a number of areas that require a
certain amount of fine-tuning in order to develop optimal arrangements.
Piloting and fine-tuning of PEM/PFM processes will be expanded to include local government
monitoring, evaluation and reporting systems. It should also include piloting of alternative ways for
VDCs (other than from their DDC) to access technical support in order to implement investment subprojects.
LGCDP will therefore undertake the following sub-activities:
•
•
•
•

Fine tune procurement and implementation procedures
Fine tune bottom-up planning & budgeting procedures
Fine tune Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and asset management procedures
Fine tune social inclusion mechanisms (dalit, women and DAG committees) in planning and
budgeting systems
• Fine tune resource sharing mechanism
• Fine tune LG reporting, monitoring and evaluation systems
• Prepare reporting, monitoring and evaluation software

5.2

Test safety net and social assistance programmes

LGCDP will pilot VDC administration and management of safety net and social assistance programmes
to provide the ultra-poor with opportunities to build up assets and to address inter-generational human
development challenges (e.g. education, health). The type of social assistance programmes to be
piloted will be cash transfer systems – both targeted/non-targeted and conditional/unconditional. The
cash transfer programmes will be clearly separated from social mobilisation, although they will include a
strong element of local community-level oversight. Safety net programme will address immediate needs
of the disadvantaged groups as identified and prioritised by their COs. Specific sub-activities will consist
of:
•
•
•
•
•
5.3

Carry out scoping study for safety net and social assistance programmes
Design safety net programme pilot
Implement safety net pilot in selected VDCs
Monitor and evaluate safety net pilot
Adjust design and implement
Pilot sector support (e.g. education, health, etc.) at the local level

In order to inform national policies on sector devolution, the programme will trial the use of conditional
sector grants (in the fields of education/health/agriculture) in a limited number of DDCs.
With regard to the piloting of sector support at the local level, LGCDP will focus on the agriculture,
health and education sectors (all of which are nominally devolved). Sector conditional grants would be
made to DDCs, which will then undertake joint planning and budgeting exercises with District education,
health and other offices. Very importantly, sector conditional grants will not be limited to capital
expenditures, but will also be used for financing operational development expenditures (e.g. travel
37

allowances, DSA, equipment, etc.) on the basis of GON budget norms. The design and implementation
of these grants will be done in close collaboration with the respective sectors and will fit into the
elaboration of sector devolution guidelines.
This will involve the following set of sub-activities:
•
•
•
•

Carry out scoping study for sector conditional grants
Design sector conditional grant pilot in close cooperation with the line ministries (LMs)
Implement sector conditional grant pilot
Monitor and evaluate sector conditional grant pilot and provide input to policy development
(output 6)
• Prepare guidelines for comprehensive devolution

5.4

Test DDC local development coordination functions (line agencies, NGOs, etc.)

A final area for LGCDP fine-tuning concerns will be DDC coordination of sector line agencies, NGOs
and donor-supported projects. Although this is mandated by LSGA, there is considerable variation in
the effectiveness and quality of DDC coordination. The programme will therefore pilot innovative
mechanisms by which DDCs can fulfil their coordination functions.
The testing out of DDC coordination functions would examine options for facilitating inter-sectoral
planning, involving NGOs and the private sector in local development activities, etc. This will include
institutional mapping exercises, establishing forums for coordination, and developing template agendas
for coordination events. Sub-activities will be:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Identify coordination needs and mechanisms
Design improved coordination mechanisms
Support implementation of improved coordination mechanisms
Monitor and evaluate DDC coordination activities
Assign tasks to divisions, sectors and officials
Evaluate performance on the basis of satisfactory tasks completion and quality of work
standards
• Activate sectoral agencies effectively and accountably

Component  3:  Strengthened  policy  and  national  institutional  framework  for 
devolution and local self­governance 
A combination of enhanced citizen voice, greater community engagement with local government,
increased fiscal resources at the local level, and local government capacity building will certainly make
a significant contribution towards poverty reduction and better public services. However, there are also
steps/actions to be taken at the policy and national levels which would further enhance programme
impact. These are covered in two outputs under this component.

38

Output 6.  

Policy  framework  for  decentralisation  promoted  a  more  enabling 
environment for effective, transparent and accountable local governance 

Delivering this output will enable LGCDP to provide a more effective policy framework within which local
governance and local government can function. Given the evolving nature of local governance policy in
the country, the activities for this output are inevitably indicative and of a “process” character.
6.1

Review decentralisation and sector devolution policy

Sector devolution policy will be prepared thorough review of existing policy frameworks and by
engaging line ministries. An updated policy framework for decentralisation will be helpful to move
towards local governance SWAp. The linkages with the work under the State Restructuring Committee
will be closely maintained in the process. Sub-activities will include:
• Review previous policies on decentralisation
• Elaborate overall sector policy for decentralisation
• Elaborate sector devolution guidelines (including procedures for HR/staffing, funding flows,
functional assignment and linkages with civil society etc.) in close interaction with line ministries
• Prepare local government audit strategy
• Prepare a national framework for child-friendly local government
6.2

Establish decentralisation SWAp

In addition to contributing towards a more enabling policy framework for local governance, LGCDP will
strengthen national capacities to support and monitor local governments through donor harmonisation
to internalise the Paris Declaration. Sub-activities will be:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
6.3

Review all development partners’ funding within decentralisation sector
Establish system for meetings between development partners and GON
Ensure linkages to decentralisation policy (and the policy components in 6.1 )
Develop investment plan for the decentralisation sector linked to GON´s budget
Establish systems and procedures for up-date of the annual work plans and budgets
Develop aligned procedures for development partners modalities
Prepare joint funding arrangements (studies, reviews, initiatives to strengthen GON systems)
Develop results framework (see under M&E)
Develop reporting systems for the use of funds
Conduct orientation/training on SWAp
Provide GON officials (MLD, etc.) with exposure to experience with SWAp
Prepare more effective policy environment for “demand” side of local governance

Preparing a more enabling environment for the “demand” side of local governance will be an invaluable
complement to “supply” side policy thinking. Lessons learned from the programme – which will include
innovative ways of enhancing transparency and accountability – would inform “demand” side policy
thinking. This activity will also include a thorough review of the constraints (e.g. access to information)
to community engagement with local governments. Sub-activities will be:
• Review existing policies and programme experiences
39

• Elaborate policy and guidelines on demand side of local governance and disseminate
6.4

Prepare improved staffing policies for local governments

Through this activity, LGDP will seek to create a more stable and effective staffing system for local
governments. This is of added importance given the ongoing absence of elected bodies. Close linkages
will be maintained with other agencies in the process - such as the involvement of MoGA, articulation
with other ongoing reform processes and the like. The staffing policy will incorporate GE/SI issues and
will be in line with the GON’s commitment for 33% women representation at all levels of the
government. Sub-activities will include
•
•
•
•
6.5

Support development of appropriate staffing policy for key seconded civil servants
Support establishment of performance-linked incentives for seconded and local staff
Support policy thinking on local service arrangements and preparation of Local Service Act
Support development of appropriate arrangements (salary scales, job descriptions, recruitment
procedures, etc.) for local government staff
Prepare National Capacity Development Strategy for local governments

Through this activity, LGCDP will support the formulation and implementation of a nation-wide and
sustainable capacity development strategy for local governments, to be overseen by the government
and implemented by the government through training institutions, regional workshops/training events,
private consultants, other development partners etc.
The development of a national capacity building strategy for local governments will take into account
the MC/PM system, the need to avoid any monopoly over the provision of training services, the role of
LB associations (ADDCN, MUAN, NAVIN) and a range of other factors.
Sub-activities will include:
• Outsource resource centres for CD strategy preparation
• Support development of CD Strategy and framework, including elements of the activity 4.1.
6.6

Conduct outcomes and impact studies of local governance and community development
programmes and outputs (evidence-based policy-making)

MLD will carry out outcomes and impact studies of community development programmes, including
those involving local body grants as well as resources used by communities and document the results
of the study. Such studies will be aimed at informing an evidence-based policy process and will not be
limited to community development. Much can be learned from other types of projects, both in Nepal and
elsewhere.
The sub-activities will be:
• Outsource for conducting studies on the outcomes and impacts of the various components and
outputs of the programme and other related programmes
• Conduct action research for the improvement of devolution process to foster local selfgovernance
• Document and publish outcomes and impacts in MLD annual reports

40

6.7

Fine-tuning of local government infrastructure and service delivery mechanisms and
processes informs national policy processes

Lessons from pilot activities will be of fundamental importance to policy processes. LGCDP will ensure,
through good coordination, that the experience gained through pilot and fine-tuning activities across the
spectrum of the programme is fed into policy analysis and thinking. This highlights the need for pilots to
be carefully/effectively monitored and properly documented.
• Monitor and document lessons learned from Output 3 and 5 activities
6.8.

Policy review and action plan regarding sector devolution

The programme will support MLD and other ministries in reviewing sector devolution policies and in
drawing up an action plan for sector devolution.
Output 7.  

Capacity of central government and national non­government institutions 
strengthened  to  provide  appropriate  support  to  local  governments  is 
enhanced 

In addition to contributing towards a more enabling policy framework for local governance, LGCDP will
also strengthen national capacities to support and monitor local governments. Indicative activities for
this output include:
7.1

Provide support for GON local governance policy analysis and policy making functions

As MLD and other Central Government institutions (e.g. MoF and NPC) strengthen their ability to
monitor local government performance, LGCDP will provide appropriate technical assistance aimed at
strengthening more evidence-based and analytical policy-making. Without line ministries developing a
capacity to fully understand and articulate sector devolution principles, they will be unlikely to make a
useful contribution to policy making in the area of decentralisation. Support for policy analysis and
policy making functions will be extended to include the important line ministries that are responsible for
the delivery of basic public services. Sub-activities will include:
• Build capacity of MLD, MoF, line ministries, NPC,PMO and other central government officials
• Support MLD’s Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) and enhance its capacities to coordinate
and replicate decentralisation and local governance support activities
• Provide technical assistance and advisory services
• Support development of social mobilisation policy
• Support development of policies and procedures for donor harmonisation
• Support policy processes (e.g. consultations with ADDCN, MuAN and NAVIN)
7.2

Provide support to LBFC

The Local Bodies’ Fiscal Commission (LBFC) should play an important advisory role with respect to
fiscal decentralisation issues and the provision of performance based block grants. The support to
LBFC should be extended to include special support for the elaboration and fine-tuning of grant
allocation formula, and support to LBFC to enable the Commission to play an active role in the
expenditure and revenue assignment and revenue mobilisation activities, review and piloting of PFM
procedures (including accounting systems).

41

To enable LBFC to play this role effectively, LGCDP will undertake a range of sub-activities, as follows:
• Provide technical assistance in defining LBFC role, functions and composition and linkages with
other institutions
• Provide training and capacity-building to LBFC officials
• Support LBFC functioning within important areas such as studies, coordination, networking
(e.g. with other fiscal commissions and related institutions), advising, assessments, monitoring,
etc.
• Provide support to development of an intergovernmental fiscal grant and development grant
policies, an up-date of the fiscal decentralisation road map, and emerging fiscal frameworks
within the context of the state restructuring
• Support annual reviews of the development of fiscal decentralisation policy
• Support operationalisation of the new role assigned to the LBFC with respect to annual
assessments of LBs performance (MC/PM system)
• Support follow-up and update the refinement and implementation of selected recommendations
from the LBFC
7.3

Provide support to LB associations (ADDCN, MuAN, and NAVIN)

Substantial support will be provided to LB associations to enhance their role in key policy discussions
with government in terms of analysis and recommendations for local bodies’ budget transfers as well as
capacity building issues. The LB associations will have a major role to play in capacity building and
dissemination of information to their members on local governance issues, including LGCDP activities.
The sub-activities will be:
• Assess capacity of the LB associations
• Support the LB associations – ADDCN, MuAN and NAVIN within their core areas such as
policy development/advocacy/development of governance policies and support to regulations,
capacity building of members LBs and quality support, dissemination, knowledge and learning
share
7.4

Support implementation of National Capacity Development Strategy for local
governments

Through this activity, LGCDP will support the formulation and implementation of a nation-wide and
sustainable capacity development strategy for local governments, to be overseen by the government
and implemented by the government through training institutions, regional workshops/training events,
private consultants, other development partners etc.
Provision of support for the implementation of a national capacity building strategy for local
governments will include a review of how MLD currently provides local bodies with capacity building
services. This will also examine (among other things) the ability of the current HR sections/units to
handle these services. Consideration will also be given to the role that LB associations can be expected
to play in the implementation of capacity building activities aimed at their respective memberships. Subactivities will include:
• Support MLD’s HR development
• Identify qualified CD service providers

42

7.5

Design and implement MLD LG performance monitoring and evaluation system

This activity will seek to improve the quality and extent to which MLD monitors local government
performance – which is an essential prelude to MLD being able to provide appropriate support. There is
an urgent need to focus on improving on the existing M&E system for both financial and physical
reporting12. The physical reporting system, in particular, is – for all intents and purposes – non-existent
at VDC and DDC levels and therefore considerable effort will be put into building up a practical and
useable set of guidelines for physical output reporting from the VDC/DDC levels. This activity will also
address the skills gaps. Sub-activities will include:
•
•
•
•

Review and design monitoring indicators, encompassing the results of the MC/PM system
Build capacity of the MLD monitoring team in results-based monitoring
Organise training on results-based monitoring
Prepare LG reporting system – fiscal as well as physical output progress reports in cooperation
with other agencies, particularly MoF and NPC
• Review/refine LB reporting system
• Support Decentralised Management Information System (DMIS) development and functioning
in MLD and linkage to Decentralised Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System (DPMAS)

7.6

Mainstream gender equality (GE) and social inclusion (SI) and child/youth inclusion
(CYI) in MLD activities

This LGCDP activity will contribute to strengthening MLD's capacity to mainstream GE/SI issues into
any and all support that it provides to local governments. A GE/SI Section will be established in the
MLD. GE/SI focal person will be identified in the DDCs and GE/SI responsive planning system will be
introduced. Municipalities and VDCs will be encouraged to follow GE/SI friendly programmes. Such
affirmative action measures will have a tangible impact on local expenditure patterns (more towards
activities favoured by these groups) and in building social acceptance of women, and excluded groups.
They also provide opportunities for women and the excluded to assert their leadership and managerial
skills and challenge patriarchal and feudal mindsets.
A range of sub-activities will be undertaken:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Restructure MLD
Establish GE/SI section in MLD and identify GE/SI focal person in DDCs
Support GON’s gender responsive budget system
Train staff in GE/SI /CYI related issues for better and GE/SI sensitive budgeting, planning and
monitoring
Review institutional arrangements for implementation of GESI/CYI strategies
Implement MLD GE/SI /CYI strategy
Review possibilities for strengthening of MLD’s support role in this area vis-à-vis LBs.
Support for the development of a GE/SI sensitive staffing policy for key civil servants.

12

In addition, in order to contribute to the inclusiveness aspect of the Program outcome, the Program will focus
on ensuring that monitoring mechanisms include a system for reporting back to the community right holders
(especially disadvantaged groups, including children, young people, and women) through the means of
public/social auditing that would hopefully enable them to initiate and influence decisions.

43

7.7
Organise capacity building programme for decentralisation focal units of various line
ministries including NPCS, MoF, PMO, MoGA, MoWC&SW, MoE, MoHP, MoAC and others
Capacity building support will be provided to the line ministries and National Planning Commission
Secretariat (NPCS) to enable them to support GON’s local governance policy. Capacity building for
decentralisation focal points in local body associations and line ministries will be undertaken to ensure
that the principles of decentralisation and sector devolution are internalised. This will, inter alia, also
ensure greater coordination of key sector reforms and the overall decentralisation reform process.
Major sub-activities will be:
•
•
•
•
•
•
7.8

Establish contacts and organise meeting of focal points
Assess core areas for capacity building
Prepare course manuals
Outsource capacity building to appropriate agencies
Conduct CD programmes
Support central level agencies in important areas such as studies, coordination, networking
(e.g. with other international institutions), advising, assessments, monitoring, etc.
Provide FCGO, OAG and ICAN with capacity building support

Capacity of the FCGO, OAG and ICAN will be strengthened under the programme with a focus on
outreach not only to DDC level but also VDC level13, elaboration of audit guidelines, training of the OAG
in new tools and programmes, including the MC/PM system, procurement regulations, accounting
systems, etc. The sub-activities will be:
• Review FCGO/OAG/ICAN local government audit capacities
• Provide FCGO/OAG/ICAN with capacity building services
7.9.

Provide support for policy coordination and exposure

Through this activity, LGCDP will support a range of initiatives (workshops, study tours, forums, etc.)
aimed at helping the Government to coordinate its sector devolution policy
Output 8.  

Support provided for programme implementation 

This output will deal with the management and programme implementation. Major sub-activities will
be:
• Review the organisation of MLD, the structures and the links with LGCDP
• Recruit core technical support staff
• Ensure basket funds for procurement of short term TA
• Provide logistical support to MLD
• Establish linkages to specific non-MLD project management functions
• Ensure funding for all staff contracted for SM
• Train MLD core responsible staff in all aspects of project management, community
development and local governance etc.
8.1

Approach Period (June – July 15, 2008)

13

It is not expected that OAG will carry out all the audits but be more involved in quality assurance and
oversight.

44

The MLD and its DPs will undertake a range of preparatory activities from June to July 15, 2008 prior to
the launch of the programme. The following activities will be carried out during approach period
Activity
1. Conduct institutional analysis of the MLD capacity to review
preparedness of MLD to perform the tasks and to deliver the
capacity building support required in the short to medium term,
and suggest recommendations including action plan.
2. Review the options for physically housing the new Programme
Coordination Unit (PCU) team and other support staff.
3. Prepare a common physical reporting system (including
standardised reporting formats) for block grant allocations and
guidelines for the utilisation of DDC grants (which will start
flowing from FY 2008/09).
4. Conduct socio-economic and environmental impact assessment.
(There is particularly a need to elaborate clear and simple
checklists for LBs preparations of projects and to describe the
legal and regulatory framework and practices within these
areas.)
5. Prepare fund flow agreements and the Joint Financing
Agreement (JFA) for SWAp.
6. Reach agreements with DPs that can finance the costs of the
Approach Period and support start-up activities in a flexible,
rapid and smooth manner.
7. Review and analysis of the findings from the planned UNCDF
funded VDC block grant study.
8. Work on the topping up grants strategy
9. Prepare and/or review the set of conditions to determine which
local body (as well as community organization) can be taken on
board for the pilot exercise so that Program outcomes can be
attained
10. Prepare AWPB for the first year of LGCDP (drawing up a
detailed annual plan and budget for the first year of LGCDP
implementation including timing, sequencing and prioritisation of
various activities).
11. Elaborate verifiable indicators for the LOGFRAME and design a
monitoring and results framework for the entire programme –
matrix and indicators, based on the LOGFRAME.
12. Prepare procurement plans and ToRs for core and other TA.
13. Advertise for long and short term TA and conduct interviews of
core staff
14. Establish the Consultative/Advisory Committee with agreements

Inception Phase (July 16, 2008 – January 2009)

As LGCDP represents a move towards a completely new system of development support for local
governance and community development and entails an innovative articulation of the demand and
supply sides, it is important that the programme is flexible, especially in the Inception Phase. The
following activities will be carried out during the Inception Phase:
• Establish the PCU closely integrated into MLD, and related management arrangements.
• Conduct a base-line study of the situation within the LBs and community organisations (level of
performance, challenges and constraints).
• Up-date the implementation and procurement plans.
• Develop operational manuals for all critical areas, particularly SM and the grant support
outputs/activities.
• Start the topping up of DDC block grants, preparation of the expansion of the VDC block grants
(to start with a rolling out from second half of the first Year) and subsequently preparation of the
grants to municipalities (to start from FY 2009/10).
• Provide support for the fine-tuning of PFM/PEM procedures.
• Assess the degree to which existing financial management processes and protocols are
adequate to ensure financial accountability of local governments (and, where necessary, of
community organization as well).
• Start up capacity building activities and TA backstopping for MLD and prepare such support for
the LBs, including preparation of the demand side based CB grants. Provide general mandatory
training to LBs.
• Develop a package of pilots and experimentation that could be applied in to give greater voice
to community groups in needs prioritization as well as access to resources.
• Carry out a joint DP-GON review (to adjust the programme).
• Organises monthly meetings with the DPs supporting LGCDP in order to coordinate activities,
particularly the CB support.
• Momentum of existing program (DFDP and DLGSP) will continue (maximum 6 months) under
the umbrella of LGCDP until the new program is commenced, and phase out of these programs
will be done during the Inception Phase. LGCDP/MLD will utilize resources and logistics of
these programmes to achieve the goals mentioned in this document. All the assets of these
programmes will be handed over to LGCDP.
• Review the existing lessons learned from the various SM approaches. Develop a common
understanding of LGCDP’s community participation and social mobilisation strategy, including
specific activities, coverage, phasing and exit strategy (UNDP, WB, DFID, SDC, GTZ, CIDA)
• Based on social mobilisation study and strategy develop guidelines for community participation
in local decision making structures, such as councils and committees (MLD).
• Develop a GE/SI strategy, with results statements and indicators explicitly spelt out as per the
Log Frame (CIDA, GTZ).
• Review and design the detailed modalities for the LG&AF (Danida/CIDA)

Programme Management  

4.1 

National level 

The programme will be executed by the Ministry of Local Development. MLD will take overall
responsibility for the programme and establish a high level government National Advisory
Committee (NAC) for overall coordination, policy advocacy and supervision of the programme, as
46

well as for making strategic recommendations concerning its implementation. This National
Advisory Committee will be chaired by the Secretary (MLD) and will consist of the MLD’s Joint
Secretaries, DG DoLIDAR, representatives of relevant Line Ministries and representatives of
development partners. The Secretary, MLD will appoint the Joint Secretary, Local Governance
Coordination Division as National Programme Director (NPD) of the LGCDP, who will act as
Member-Secretary for the committee. The committee will meet at least twice a year.

4.1.2  Programme Coordination Unit 
The LGCDP Programme Coordination Unit (PCU) will be established as a programme unit under
the Local Governance Coordination Division of MLD (Annex 3) and will ensure the internal
coordination of policy activities related to LGCDP through the Policy Coordination Committee
(PCC) that already exists within MLD.
LGCDP will be managed on a full-time basis by an Under Secretary from MLD, acting as
Programme Manager (PM) and heading the PCU regularly, who reports through the Joint
Secretary/NPD to the MLD Secretary and to the NAC. DPD will be accountable to NPD and will be
involved in daily supervision.
Within the PCU there will be specific, dedicated, Output Managers for each of the Programme
outputs, selected from amongst the various section chiefs who will be PCU members. This will
introduce a degree of accountability internally in MLD in terms of result based output management.
The diagram on the next page provides a suggested allocation of output responsibilities to various
MLD sections. PCU/Output Managers will meet monthly to discuss issues regarding programme
implementation and the PCU will prepare trimesterly progress reports.
The PCU will prepare annual work plans and budgets (AWPB) and present them to the PCC. The
AWPB will be linked to GON systems and based on LSGA/LBFAR. Furthermore, the PCU will be
responsible for drawing up Procurement Plans in accordance with the 2007 Procurement Act and
Regulations.
The PCU technical cell will include a full-time national team leader cum decentralization and local
governance specialist and other national specialists such as i) local government capacity building,
ii) local government finance, iii) financial management, iv) social mobilisation and accountability, v)
47

GE/SI, vi) M&E, vii) MIS/GIS and communications (see the table below)14. These technical
specialists will work under the under the daily supervision of the national team leader who will be
accountable to PM. PM will be accountable and report to NPD. They will provide technical
assistance and support to the Output Managers. The new recruitment process, will take place
within the inception phase.
In addition to the full-time national team leader, technical specialists, the PCU could also draw on
international expertise to provide exposure to national and international good practice and technical
core expertise. The PCU team and other support staff will be housed in MLD premises. PCU can
decide to draw technical assistance as and when necessary.
The PCU will also include (at least for the first two years of programme implementation) two
management specialists/advisers. One would provide MLD with support to undertake procurement
activities (according to the provisions of the 2007 Procurement Act and related regulations). The
other would provide MLD’s General Administration Division with support for LGCDP-related
financial management (consolidated reports, withdrawal applications, etc.).
The meetings of the output managers will be held at least once a month.

Note: Each output will be co-ordinated and maintained by the concerned Division Heads and
forwarded horizontally to program Director. PM will liaison the output related activities with the
concerned Output manager/ Section Chiefs and Division Heads. A separate liaison and network will
be developed during inception phase to assure effective coordination and efficiency of the LGCDP
implementation.
Sections in bold denotes output management responsibilities. Programme Manager will coordinate
all Output Managers and sections. It is expected that the responsibility areas will be further broken
down under the Output Managers incorporating all relevant sections working under MLD. LBFC will
coordinate the activities within the area of local governance finance including MC/PM system,
revenue studies. GE/SI section will be linked to Community Participation, Social Mobilization and
policy. Further elaboration and adjustments will be done based on MLD’s intuitional assessment.
The PCC may decide to establish regional liaison offices to provide implementation and monitoring
support for the programme.

Local level (District/Municipality/VDC) 

The Local Development Officer (LDO) will coordinate the LGCDP activities at district level, by the
Executive Officer at municipal level and by the VDC secretary at the VDC level. The LGCDP
activities will be integrated into the local bodies’ plans and DDC/municipal/VDC councils will
approve LGCDP action plans at respective levels.
A maximum of 7% of the block grants should be earmarked by DDC, 5% municipalities and VDCs
to finance investment servicing costs (contracting of short term contracted support staff (minimum
one person will be recruited but not permanent employees), consultants, NGOs, etc).
Recruitment/procurement processes for this should be transparent and subject to appropriate
checks and balances. Of the 7 %, for DDCs, each DDC should earmark about 2% (according to
guidelines) for support to VDCs in areas such as planning, appraisal, and financial management
and monitoring. DDC will have rights to recruit one District Programme Facilitator as per its existing
recruiting system however the qualification will be set by National Advisory Committee.
The DDCs, municipalities and the VDCs will receive substantial capacity building support from the
supply driven training organised by the central government as well as the demand driven capacity
building grants to be designed (as part of output 4). To the extent possible, the Program will also
seek to ensure that such capacity building support can be utilized by community groups.

5. 

Implementation Modality 
50

MLD will be responsible for policy level interventions as well as coordination with other ministries.
PCU will be responsible for the outputs of the LGCDP where as Local Bodies will be for responsible
for local level implementation.

5.1 

Implementation Arrangements 

LGCDP activities will be implemented by local bodies through user committees/school
management committees/health management committees etc., community organisations,
federations of community organisations (e.g. CMCs), cooperatives, local NGOs, line agencies and
public-private-partnership arrangements.
5.1.1  Towards a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) 
MLD intends to move towards a sector wide approach (SWAp) to manage the local governance
sector, rather than having a series of projects with their own funding, management, implementation,
and reporting arrangements. Key features of sector wide management, which will be developed
and introduced during LGCDP, are:
a) The provision of a single clear sector policy and strategic framework that links the sector
policies and the LGCDP including the expenditure plans for the sector, so that the
allocation of resources reflects the priorities for the sector.
b) Annual programme and budget which specify the activities to be carried out under each
strategic objective and by department/divisions/local bodies.
c) Reporting on activities and performance indicators against the plan, with common reporting
and performance monitoring arrangements (rather than each funding and supporting
agency having its own review process and missions).
It is expected that as local governance sector reform progress and experience is gained in
operating a sector management approach, a rising share of the external support will be provided
through pooled funding and on the basis of common procedures (including financial management).
MLD and DPs aim to sign a Letter of Intent by June 2008 and Joint Financial Agreement by the end
of Year One15 in order to operationalise harmonisation initiatives. This will include agreement about
the role (within overall DPs assistance) of the programme partners with their related funding
mechanisms, at both national as well as district, municipal and VDC level. It will address the issues
of the extent to which (and within what timeframe) MLD will be able to take responsibility for
implementation of all programmes and projects.
At this stage DPs may continue to provide support in kind (TA, commodities, and equipment) or in
the form of earmarked grants for specified activities or budget items. However, it is envisaged that
all DPs and other external sources will provide the necessary information on allocations, which will
then be reflected in the GON budgetary system. MLD’s Local Governance Division, in collaboration
with the Planning and Foreign Aid Coordination Division, will take the lead in documenting current
DPs disbursement and reporting arrangements and those of government, and explaining how they
fit together in order to guide harmonisation.

15

The Letter of Intent will also include how EDPs will provide support in the short term prior to adoption of full
SWAp.

51

On commencement of LGCDP, MLD will work with DPs to review each externally supported
project, in order to gauge consistency with the priorities and activities of the LGCDP and to agree
on any necessary modifications to DPs support.
There are three major management changes envisaged during the implementation of the LGCDP.
These are:
a.
b.
c.

MLD taking responsibility for implementation of projects currently managed by the
DPs (and their contracted agencies).
Decentralisation with clear performance management arrangements.
MLD and DoLIDAR moving towards a facilitator/financier and policy making role

5.1.2   Participatory Planning Process based on LSGA 
The participatory planning process as provided for by the LSGA will be followed (Annex 4). COs
and their federation/cooperatives will be involved in the participatory planning process. Participation
of women, dalit and janajatis will be mandatory in the process.
5.1.3  Financial Management 
The LSGA, LBFAR, LSGR will together be the basis for fund flows to local bodies, as well as for
programme and budget management. Accounting and auditing of local bodies will be maintained as
per LSGA and LBFAR. MLD will follow central level financial regulations of GON, whereas, the local
bodies will follow the Local Bodies Financial Administration Regulations 2064. An assessment will
be carried out to ascertain the degree to which existing financial management processes and
protocols are adequate to ensure financial accountability of local governments (and, where
necessary, of community organization as well).
5.1.3.1 Funds Flow  

LGCDP National Advisory Committee will approve the annual indicative plan and block grant
allocations of the programme. The following funds flow mechanisms will be adopted in the LGCDP.
a. Fund flow and funding mechanisms will be according to the JFA and programme
implementation guidelines.
b. Programmes and budget of the LGCDP will be incorporated into the Annual Budget
(Redbook) of the GON. GON, as well as donor agencies’ resources, will be released to
the District Development Fund (DDF) and Municipal Development Fund (MDF) from
the Central Treasury. The DDC will then facilitate the release of funds to the Village
Development Fund (VDF) and/or CDF or CBOs and then to the communities.
c. Top up grants will be blended together with the GON block grant in the form of capacity
development grants and capital expenditure grants. A minimum of thirty-three percent
of the VDC capital expenditure will be allocated to projects selected by disadvantaged
groups ), including available for use by community groups to strengthen their own
capabilities

52

d. For the expanded block grant (topping up), one common consolidated system for the
flow of funds through the National Treasury system (FCGO – DTCO - LBs) will be used
for all funds, thereby enabling a blend of funds from the outset, as well as consolidated
reporting, monitoring and accountability.
The systems and procedures for the flow of funds will be improved in the following areas:
• Transfer of funds will be linked to submission of financial as well as physical output reports – no
reports from the LBs will mean no future transfers until all problems have been resolved.
• Support will be provided for strengthening LB audits and OAG capacity building, including
support for the development of new audit guidelines for LBs.
• Funds will be transferred in three equal instalments on condition that reports from the last fourmonthly period, but one, have been submitted correctly and on time. In FY 2008/09, the existing
system will be applied.
• Possibility of setting aside a given portion of the top-up grants received by local bodies to be
used to experiment with innovative and flexible methods of service delivery and attaining the
Program outcome
The funding flow for the capacity building grant (from year 2 when it is up and running) will use the
same route as the development block grants (i.e. through the national Treasury system).
DPs and GoN will sign a JFA on the modalities for flow of funds, reporting, pledging of funds, etc.
This will be done as soon as possible in the Approach Period and all parties should closely monitor
the flow of funds, and take quick and firm actions in case of delays or irregularities. The system will
be flexible and allow for change, if there are reasons for concerns and problems with the suggested
modality.
The DPs supporting the JFA will make funds available to GON through a foreign exchange account
in the name of the MOF in the NRB, to be used exclusively to finance the Programme
Funding to cover the costs of social mobilisation will go from the DPs to the MLD LGCDP Account
and from there directly to the various local bodies and not be part of the block grant system as SM
has to do with the demand, not supply, side.
Funds for the VDCs will go through the DDC (see the figure below) to the VDF in the short term,
until sufficient capacity is built up at the VDC level to handle direct transfers from the district
treasury. Capacity will be targeted towards achieving this objective within the Programme period at
a much earlier point of time. The coming VDC block grant studies would provide valuable guidance
on where the bottlenecks are and how the system can be prepared so as to handle direct transfers
to the VDCs while keeping the monitoring responsibilities of the DDCs intact.

5.1.3.3 Funding 

A number of development partners have signed a letter of intent to support the GON within the areas of
local governance and community development over a longer time period. The LGCDP is seen as the
first phase of a long term programme of support. Although Government structures and systems are
likely to change over the coming years, LGCDP should be seen as the first phase of a longer term
programme of support to local governance and community development strengthening both the
demand and the supply sides of local service delivery and good governance.
The table below provides an overview of the funding that is expected to be available for LGCDP from
the various Development Partners.

DDC grant 20 million, Municipal grant 20 million and
188 million VDC grants (capital grants only for 4
years).
Funding for the entire LGCDP, e.g. through a JFA
(preferred). It is going to be in form of “programmatic”
support, probably transferred in two instalments as
budget support with some few conditions. A quick
elaboration of a JFA is absolutely critical for the
processing of the support.
A part of this support will be earmarked for local peace
committees.
In addition to this support there is expected to be funds
available for TA support to GE/SI.

clarified their commitment. Other UN agencies are in a
process of reviewing their ongoing activities and links
to the LGCDP.
About 11 million USD for the four years 2008-2012, i.e.
2-3 million annually. The funds can start being utilised

Expects about 4 million USD of which about 0.5 million
USD could be spent in the coming FY (2008/09).
Funding in the coming years will be as project support
to specific activities coordinated with LGCDP. It is
important to explore further exactly which of the
existing budgets lines in the LGCDP can be taken on
board/supported by the funding from GTZ and be an
integrated part of the overall budget available for the
activities.

The WB is considering support to local governance
and community development, and planning is ongoing.
In principle, the WB is positive towards a joint national
LGCDP. At the moment, a clear commitment is not
available and no decision has yet been taken about
the future support and its modalities. Funds (realistic
figure: 100 million US$) will be available if the
programme is positively appraised by mid 2009, but
will require significant planning and programming.

5.1.3.4 Funding Modalities 

57

• Various funding modalities will be allowed, but with a view towards moving gradually into a
genuine SWAp over the next 3-4 years. For the time being, all the DPs will provide support in a
coherent, comprehensive and coordinated manner and fully aligned with LGCDP’s
programmatic framework, thus reducing the overlaps, funding gaps and lack of coordination
that have characterised the local governance and community-led development sector in the
past.
• The DPs and the GON would seek gradually to move towards harmonised and aligned
procedures for support to LGCDP. During the first years, various modalities will co-exist, but it
is important from the outset of the Programme to ensure strong coordination of the activities
through monthly meetings between MLD and the DPs (led by MLD), through bi-annual joint
reviews of the overall activities within LGCDP. ToRs for consultancies will be shared and
coordinated to avoid overlap and to ensure sufficient synergies between various initiatives.
• GON’s and LBs” audit procedures and systems will be applied, but will be allowed to make onthe-spot checks and audits in agreement with MLD and the OAG.
• A JFA will be elaborated as soon as possible. The areas and DPs covered by the JFA should
gradually expand as experience is gained and as trust is built up in the effectiveness of GON
processes, supported by strong CB/TA in critical areas.
• The following funding modalities will be applied in the programme period:
i. Basket funding arrangement in the form of a JFA, with one budget funding flows.
This JFA will particularly cover the flow of funds to blended GON block grants and
topping-up of the block grants, but other areas may be considered as well; and the
JFA will cover the support from those DPs which can apply JFA/basket fund
arrangements, using GON procedures.
ii. Basket funding TA arrangement will be managed in a joint MLD/UN system, using
the mutually agreed National Implementation Guidelines.
iii. DPs willing to fund special budget lines of LGCDP, but with strong coordination of
the support to ensure synergies and complementarity, will be accommodated as
per mutually agreed upon criteria between GON and DPs.

5.1.4  Monitoring and reporting 
5.1.5.1 Monitoring 

A performance monitoring and evaluation system will be developed as soon as possible. GE/SI issues
will be integrated into the LG performance monitoring and evaluation system with inclusion of GE/SI
sensitive indicators, gender and other socially disaggregated data.
On-the-ground monitoring and mentoring will be done by a roving support & monitoring teams from the
centre consisting of key MLD/PCU and line agency staff. These Teams will operate under the
supervision of MLD and the central LGCDP team. These Teams will in principle comprise national
specialists in local governance, social mobilization, local capacity building/planning, financial
management and monitoring. These roving Teams will have a dual role: on one hand, providing support
to local government and monitoring performance; on the other and, interacting with (and, in some
cases, contracting), backstopping and monitoring the LBs, various NGOs and other social mobilisation
agencies active in the area.
Memorandum of understandings will be signed between MLD and DDCs/municipalities, which spell out
their respective roles and responsibilities in LGCDP. The role of MLD will be supportive, coordinative,
approval of AWPB, policy guidance, M&E, reporting and capacity development. Management
guidelines will be developed for DDCs/municipalities.
The Joint Annual Reviews (JAR) will be organised bi-annually, wherein GON and all development
partners would participate. The first JAR (timing around November/December) will be the mechanism
for proposing changes to the Programme document, in the implementation modalities etc. The JAR will
be preceded by donor/Government assessments of implementation, systems, fact finding field visits,
management issues etc. A second joint meeting will be conducted in May/June every year, when the
annual work-plans, budgets, procurement plans and coordination of support and TA will be agreed
upon.
59

Other monitoring will be done as below:
Local level:
•
•
•
•

Monthly, trimesterly and annual programme reviews by PICs at the local bodies level,
Public audit will be conducted at community level once a year,
Social audit will be conducted at institutional level (i.e. local bodies) once a year, and
Public hearing will be conducted by local bodies once a year.

MLD level
•
•
•

Monthly/trimesterly and annual review by MLD,
Mid-term review after eighteen months of implementation, and
External review in the beginning of the fourth year of programme implementation.

5.1.5.2 Reporting 

Reporting formats for the LGCDP will be developed and provided to all the local bodies at a very early
stage. A robust system for physical progress reporting, linked to a facility/office in MLD, will be
established - which consolidates reviews and follows up on reports. The progress, efficiency and
effectiveness of the project will be planned and monitored through a regular reporting system as
follows:
•
•
•

Monthly reports
Trimesterly progress reports
Annual progress reports

The LGCDP will publish Annual Monitoring and Performance Reports that will include both physical and
financial progress including major achievements. The Nepalese Fiscal Year will be followed for fund
disbursement and progress reporting.

Fiduciary Risks 

A recent review of overall Public Financial Management Performance in Nepal (PEFA – February 2008)
suggests generally “high” fiduciary risks and indicates a number of areas in need of improvement.
Among these areas are: (a) transparency in the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system; and (b)
reporting and oversight on the part of various agencies, including the local bodies, which show very
poor performance. An action plan has been drawn up and agreements reached to target the weaker
PFM areas over the coming years that will be applicable to the LGCDP as well.
The following are the fiduciary risks associated with LGCD

political parties towards empowering local governments for service
delivery. A number of other measures are in place, including social
audit, public hearing, public disclose of LB performance etc.
There is an increasing activism amongst marginalised groups to
ensure “voice” – and this will be resisted with difficulty by local
elites. In addition, this and other programmes will work hard to
provide incentives for disadvantaged groups to voice themselves
and to be heard.
Civil society/community’s pressure to all the stakeholders will be
inclusive through SM component
SMs will receive training in these issues
DPs through regular joint monitoring, feedback and reviews put
pressure on the government. Mitigating measures and adjustment
of funding flows may be considered, but the first step will be to
strengthen the control and capacity of involved partiers in flow of
funds.
Technical Assistance will be provided for key areas
There should be a system to ensure that prior to any communities
being allocated any level of resources, there is not only an
assessment of the capability to manage the resources, but also that
there is a protocol in place to monitor such use
Some part of the capacity development grant can be set aside for
use by community groups so that they are better able to manage
the resources that they would lay claim over
Regular monitoring by local bodies would also help
Support to OAG, development of LB audit guidelines, training, and
support to system with QA of VDC audit.
The MC/PM system promote LB incentives to follow-up on
irregularities identified in the audit reports
The MC/PM system promotes LB incentives to follow-up on
irregularities identified in the audit reports. MCPM system will be
continue at the DDC level; to be extended at municipal level; and
DDC will introduce a simple mechanism of MCPM for VDC level
(with the support of MLD); Internal audit system will be
strengthened and audit report will be published for transparency.
The MC/PM system promotes internal audit and has had an impact
in the 20 districts where it has been piloted. Rolling out of the
system is likely to improve financial management performance and
internal audit, based on MTRs of DFDP and external fiduciary risks
assessments (DFID, 2006).
The new Procurement Act and Regulations are useful tools in
strengthening of the public procurement
Standards are set and in place by MLD

have agreed to coordinate their capacity building support.
MLD will take a strong lead in DP coordination.
The MC/PM system promotes proper planning processes
Most projects will be small scale projects without environmental
impact
Screening tools will be developed to ensure that the LBs considers
this important issue in planning and implementation
The MC/PM system should be up-dated annually to incorporate
lessons learned and to further deepen and widen fiduciary
safeguards as necessary. This should be combined with a major
programme of supply- and demand-driven capacity building for the
LBs (the AT endorses this part of the PD, but sufficient funds
should be allocated to these important initiatives). It should be
emphasized that the assessments should be done in an impartial,
independent and external manner with a strong level of quality
assurance.

by MLD in consultations with EDPs. As with the participatory indicators used in DAG mapping, these
ranking indicators combine both economic and socio-cultural dimensions of DAG-ness. They are used
together as a set to rank VDCs (or wards). Information is collected from readily available secondary
sources. Criteria used are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

HHs with food sufficient <3 months
Concentration of marginalized HHs
Access to primary school
Access to health posts
Participation of women, dalit and janajati in planning, execution and decisions making
Prevalence of gender discrimination
Prevalence of vulnerable HHs

(Note: Mapping will be done according to natural settlements and access of the inhabitants rather than
limiting them within administrative demarcation of wards and VDCs.)

No.

Indicators

1

Food sufficiency of <3 months (concentration of daily-wage labourers, out-migration in search of
labour, economic enslavement and bonded labour (kamaiya, hali, haruwa/charuwa)

2

Marginalized groups (such as Dalits, janajati, etc., resulting in socio-cultural discrimination,
untouchability, verbal abuse, social exclusion in public gatherings and non-acceptability of ethnic
cultures)

3

Lack of access (functional and responsive) to basic services: primary-level school and sub health
post (deprivation and low affordability of basic services)

4

Low level of representation/participation of women, Dalits and janajati in formal decision-making
bodies such as VDC, School Management Committees, Health Management Committees, local
NGOs, etc. (lack of recognition of existence, lack of awareness of the rights of women and
marginalized groups, illiteracy and low acceptability)

5

Prevalence of gender discrimination (such as early marriage, girls not sent to school, superstition of
witch, violence against women, polygamy, polyandry, dowry, chaupadi (the practice of keeping
women away from the house during pregnancy and delivery without proper care), parda (the practice
of keeping women in a veil, etc.)
