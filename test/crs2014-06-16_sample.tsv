The project has the following four components: Component 1) Sub-component 1A is to improve the health system so that it can respond to medical aspects of the epidemic and prevent HIV transmission, particularly through safe blood transfusion and better bio-security in general. Sub-component 1B) The National Strategic Plan for the fight against HIV-AIDS also sets forth the response of ministries other than the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) which have under vulnerable groups and at-risk sectors under their jurisdiction. The project supports these ministries. Component 2) Will support efforts that emerge from civil society to prevent the spread and to reduce the impact of HIV-AIDS. These efforts may come from local institutions such as NGOs, community-based organizations including faith-based organizations and parent-teacher associations, as well as trade unions, and to a degree, the private sector. Component 3) HIV-AIDS, civil conflict, and the decline of the public health system all contributed to the emergence of a large and growing cohort of orphans and other extremely vulnerable children (OVC) in the Congo. This component addresses the OVC issue at a meaningful scale by investing in the health, education and overall well-being of these children. Component 4) Sub-component 4A) Will strengthens the capacity of the Congo to fight against HIV/AIDS by supporting the CNLS, and its Permanent Executive Secretariat. Sub-component 4B) Will supports capacity strengthening and training (and supply of related equipment and materials) in the CNLS and its Permanent Executive Secretariat, in Government ministries, and in civil society. Sub-component 4C) Monitoring & Evaluation. This subcomponent follows a plan developed under the Project Preparation Facility. Sub-component 4D): Data collection at the national level. Because of instability and civil conflict, no one has collected systematic health and demographic data for the past 10 years. These data are necessary for rational planning of investments in health and in the fight against HIV-AIDS and for monitoring & evaluation. Therefore this component will support a Congo demographic and health survey."|

CN	"Gansu and Inner Mongolia Poverty Reduction Project"|"GANSU AND INNER MONGOLIA POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT"|"The Western Poverty Reduction Project aims to reduce the incidence of absolute poverty in remote and inaccessible villages of Gansu and Qinghai Provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in China. The project empowers poor households in the selected poor counties to raise their incomes, through increased grain and livestock production sufficient to meet the basic needs of food and clothing and, in many cases, also generate a marketable surplus to improve living standards. The project has eight components. The first supports land and household development by providing improved agricultural and livestock technology packages--seeds, fertilizer, insecticides, plastic mulches, breeding/fattening stock; developing forests; and upgrading agricultural and livestock support services. The second component improves irrigation and land by building a new dam, renovating an existing dam, and constructing irrigation and drainage systems. The other six components 1) improve rural roads, build drinking water supply facilities, and extend electric power lines; 2) provide credit to establish non-state owned and household-based rural enterprises; 3) organize and place on a voluntary basis surplus rural laborers in off-farm employment; 4) support voluntary placement of some of the absolute poor living in mountains and local herders and farmers; 5) construct and upgrade basic education and health facilities; and 6) fund institution building and project management. Note: The above abstract is derived from the Project Appraisal Document. An updated project description as of March 10, 2003 is provided below: A loan of $160 million for the China Western Poverty Reduction Project was approved by the Bank's Board on June 24, 1999. The project originally included three components in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as well as Gansu and Qinghai Provinces. While project activities in Gansu and Inner Mongolia began shortly thereafter, no Bank funds were disbursed or work undertaken on the Qinghai component until the Bank's Board could decide on the results of a review by the Bank's Inspection Panel. On July 7, 2000, after extensive discussions with the Bank's Management and Board of Directors, the Chinese authorities decided to cancel the Qinghai component of the project and undertake the work with their own resources. Consistent with this decision, the project was renamed the Gansu and Inner Mongolia Poverty Reduction Project."|

The loan supports the Government's public policy statements and agenda in key economic areas with a specific focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability, enhancing the investment climate, and improving public financial management and anti-corruption. In addition, it provides vital financing at a critical stage and provides an effective vehicle for the Bank to engage the new administration. The expected results of this approach include sustained macro stability, an improved investment climate, greater government accountability, and improved public services for the poor. The proposed DPL supports the policy reforms in the following areas: Macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness: The administration has indicated its commitment to build on the fiscal discipline achieved, and a willingness to address problematic issues in subsidies, tax compliance, and inter-governmental fiscal transfers. Investment climate: The administration has expressed its commitment to continued tax and customs reforms, given the problems in these areas. Public financial management and anti-corruption: The administration is committed to continuing fiduciary and budget reforms through, and among other actions, issuing implementing regulations for several laws, establishing a Treasury Single Account, and strengthening the Inspector General's office. By 2007, these reforms are expected to result in significant improvements to budgeting and transparency, and accountability in public financial management."|

To achieve these objectives, the project will: (i) improve an equitable and reliable water supply in the command area; and (ii) improve water distribution among farmers below the 10 ha block outlets and promote better water management on the farm. This will require a number of complementary activities, including strengthening of the project organization for operation and maintenance, on-farm development, introduction of rotational water supply below the block outlet, establishment of farmer organizations, and training of project staff and farmers in new management practices. As this is an integral part of a continuing project the risks are considered less than average for irrigation projects of similar size and scope. Cost estimates are firm as they are based on the experience of the on-going project. Projections of yields are conservative and are well within the reach of the average farmer's capability."|

If the vision of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement is to be achieved in Southern Sudan, solid and effective governance infrastructure is essential, including electoral and referenda practices. The purpose of this project is to support civic and voter education in marginalized communities (women, youth, and internally displaced persons), the establishment of regional and state-level civic and voter education consortia, support co-ordination and planning by the donor elections Assistance Group and the training of up to 500 Sudanese trainers, both women and men. CIDA's contribution strengthens the ability of the Government of National Unity and the Government of South Sudan to meet their peace agreement commitments through increased support to democratic processes countrywide. / Le Programme sur les élections et la gouvernance démocratique au Soudan a pour objectif de renforcer l’efficacité des institutions soudanaises responsables des élections et des référendums et d’améliorer leurs pratiques.

Par ailleurs, le Programme vise à former jusqu’à 500 formateurs soudanais, femmes et hommes.

This initiative is no longer being promoted in Montenegro but assignments there are taking place on a responsive basis only. Originally, Azerbaijan was eligible for CESO services but the programming in this country has ceased in 2006.   Through 3-4 week assignments, Canadian Volunteer Advisors (VAs) provide technical assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government ministries in these countries.   Assignments are effective because they are demand-driven and are designed to respond to the needs of the client. In order to respond to the clients' specific needs, CESO maintains a roster of over 2,700 potential VAs who are mainly retired and semi-retired Canadian men and women with a range of experience and knowledge to share with clients.   Results as of June 2008: CESO has delivered more than 650 assignments allowing 6,500 people from SMEs, governments, and NGOs to be trained primarily in the business sector. This transfer of knowledge from Canadian volunteers to local beneficiaries has led to improved human resources, management practices, and upgraded customer service and product quality. / L'objectif du programme du Service d'assistance canadienne aux organismes (SACO) est d'encourager les partenaires/clients sélectionnés à accroître de manière significative leur contribution au bien-être des hommes et des femmes sur le plan économique, social et politique, dans les pays ciblés par le programme, soit en Ukraine, Russie, Serbie, Monténégro, Géorgie et Arménie. SACO ne fait plus la promotion de cette initiative au Monténégro mais des affectations peuvent s'y dérouler sur une base réactive seulement. À l'origine, ce projet était opérationnel en Azerbaïdjan mais les activités du SACO dans ce pays ont pris fin en 2006.   Dans le cadre d'affectations de 3 à 4 semaines, des volontaires canadiens offrent de l'assistance technique aux petites et moyennes entreprises (PME), à des organisations non-gouvernementales (ONG) et à des entités gouvernementales établies dans les pays ciblés par le programme.   L'efficacité de ces affectations tient du fait qu'elles sont orientées par la demande et sont conçues pour répondre aux besoins des clients du SACO. Afin de répondre adéquatement aux besoins spécifiques formulés par les clients, le SACO maintien un bassin de plus de 2 700 conseillers volontaires qui est composé d'hommes et de femmes généralement retraités ou semi-retraités. Ces personnes ont le potentiel de partager à leurs partenaires un large éventail d'expériences et de savoir.   Les résultats rapportés en juin 2008 démontrent que le SACO a livré plus de 650 affectations qui ont permis de former 6 500 personnes oeuvrant dans des PME, des ONG et dans des institutions gouvernementales Les formations ciblaient particulièrement les connaissances reliées au milieu entrepreneurial. En transférant leurs connaissances aux bénéficiaires locaux, les conseillers volontaires ont contribué à améliorer leurs pratiques de gestion humaines et financières et à hausser la qualité de leurs produits et de leurs services destinés aux consommateurs."|
