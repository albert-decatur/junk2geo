In the mean time a high level committee, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Education with representation of various public and private agencies, was set up in February 2010 to prepare a TEVT policy framework and submit to the Government. The Committee under the NPC set up a sub-committee to facilitate the work of the ministerial level committee, and the sub-committee submitted a concise report containing strategies and corresponding actions for TEVT policy framework.

Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Food security in Nepal is alarmingly low, with 49% of children under 5 years old stunted, 25% severely stunted, 13% wasted, and 3% severely wasted. The majority of small and marginal farmers cannot achieve their productivity potential since they have unreliable or no access to irrigation water and improved agricultural technology. Small farmers without irrigation include the disadvantaged Dalit, Janajati and Muslim populations who live and cultivate rain-fed land in peripheral water-scarce areas on steep slopes away from fertile and water-rich valleys in the hills and on the fringes of irrigation systems in the plains. Irrigation is key to increasing the production of staple crops to meet the growing gap between agricultural production and the needs of the expanding population and to diversifying and intensifying agriculture to increase on-farm incomes, reduce rural poverty, and increase food security. Irrigation therefore has a critical role to play in Nepal s poverty reduction and food security strategies. For individuals and households, access to irrigation reduces the severity of rural poverty by increasing (i) food production, (ii) on-farm employment, and (iii) incomes. The project addresses the three pillars of ADB's country partnership strategy, 2010-2012: (i) broad- based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) governance and capacity building. It builds on lessons learned from past assistance in the agriculture and natural resources sector and complements the interventions of other development partners. The project supports the multisector approach advocated in ADB's Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, as it aims to improve water productivity, access to microfinance, and the application of improved agricultural practices. The project's interventions will be underpinned by associated capacity building at district and community levels. **** Impact **** Agricultural income of rural poor and socially excluded groups is increased. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Poor, women, and other disadvantaged farmers in target communities intensify and diversify their agricultural practices toward higher value crops. Progress Towards Outcome Outputs towards achieving outcome have not yet been started/not yet due. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs WUAs efficiently manage improved irrigation infrastructure. Participating farmers apply improved agriculture practices and have access to microfinance. Government capacity to plan and coordinate small-scale irrigation projects is enhanced. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Till now 168 WUA are Registered. They are having 36% (>33%) female and proportional representation of DAG in membership is complied. Pre-construction training was conducted focusing enhancement of WUA capacity in planning implementation, and operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. Training on water management plan is being provided to WUAs after completion of construction works. WUA of completed subprojects already started to implement. There is WUA commitment at the time of subproject demand and will be complied at the time of completion. It will be assessed only after the completion and operation of the ISPs. RMDC trained MFIs are forming farmers saving & credit groups meeting the target of female participants. Project selection is done according to the project selection criteria by the village leaders. Training plan have been prepared and CIP engineers and sub engineers were trained for project design and implementation. DDC/DTO is coordinating the works with DADO and other district government officials. Provision has been made in the plan and will be executed. Training/Observation tour for LDO/DTO is completed. CIP engineers training are being conducted regularly. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: C Indigenous Peoples: B **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect A Project Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) guides the preparation of environmental due diligence for the subprojects. Environmental due diligence is incorporated into the Feasibility Assessment Reports. In accordance with the EARF, Initial Environmental Examinations will be prepared for irrigation subprojects with 150 ha or more of command area. So far, no subproject more than 150 ha has been demanded by farmers. Involuntary Resettlement No involuntary resettlement will be used in the Project, as the Project's subproject selection criteria requires that the irrigation improvement is desired by the community and WUA members voluntarily donate any small parcels of land needed for irrigation enhancement. A Resettlement Framework has been prepared to ensure the subproject selection criteria have been met, and to clearly identify the triggers, if any, for more comprehensive safeguards (i.e. resettlement plan). Resettlement due diligence is required to be incorporated into each subproject Feasibility Assessment Report, and will document verification that any land required has been given voluntarily, and that nobody is impoverished by the land donation. If more than 5% of anyone's total land holding is donated, the WUAs must negotiate livelihood restitution measures with the affected party. Indigenous Peoples Indigenous peoples (IPs) are not expected to be affected seriously or at all by the Project, whether it is through loss of livelihoods, displacements, or impacts on their social and cultural identity. Impacts on IPs are expected to be positive, as IPs living in subproject areas will benefit from the access to irrigation, increased agricultural yields, and improved food security. The Project's Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework guides the preparation of subprojects to ensure equitable distribution of benefits and to promote development of the IPs and ethnic minorities along with other disadvantaged groups. The Feasibility Assessment Reports must document due diligence on IPs to ensure that there are no adverse effects on IPs and that interventions are designed with greatest possible reduction of poverty among IPs. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Identification of ISPs are done with wide consultation and information dissemination to the farmers at grass root level. Communities are continually consulted at all stage of the ISPs. The project is planning to organize a multistakeholder workshop on the project activities in near future. During Project Implementation The Project has a Consultation and Participation Plan. This plan has been prepared to ensure local ownership of each CIP subproject, ensure inclusion of all types of user stakeholder groups in participation processes and benefit distribution, and to ensure dissemination of results and lessons learned to the wider community, including interested government, NGOs and civil society organizations. The socio-economic survey of each subproject will flag those households requiring support to enhance their meaningful participation in the activities of the project. These groups will receive targeted coaching. The Project Coordination Unit will analyze each sub-project based on its socio- economic profile and suggest targets and methods for participation assistance. They will also provide training support to the field teams in this respect. In order to ensure the project may learn from other relevant activities and vice versa, the Project Coordination Unit will invite government organizations, NGOs and community-based organizations to periodic workshops to discuss project results, and in particular periodic specialized studies on such topics as gender, poverty impact or other case studies. During the inception mission the stakeholder consultation and participation plan prepared at PPTA stage was reviewed and revised.The following have been integrated: targeted participation actions for social preparation, community and WUA meetings, and training events from each of the safeguard documents into the plan.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 17 May 2010     * Fact-finding: 17 May 2010 to 28 May 2010     * Management Review Meeting: 30 Apr 2007     * Approval: 27 Sep 2010     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Food security in Nepal is alarmingly low, with 49% of children under 5 years old stunted, 25% severely stunted, 13% wasted, and 3% severely wasted. The majority of small and marginal farmers cannot achieve their productivity potential since they have unreliable or no access to irrigation water and improved agricultural technology. Small farmers without irrigation include the disadvantaged Dalit, Janajati and Muslim populations who live and cultivate rain-fed land in peripheral water-scarce areas on steep slopes away from fertile and water-rich valleys in the hills and on the fringes of irrigation systems in the plains. Irrigation is key to increasing the production of staple crops to meet the growing gap between agricultural production and the needs of the expanding population and to diversifying and intensifying agriculture to increase on-farm incomes, reduce rural poverty, and increase food security. Irrigation therefore has a critical role to play in Nepal s poverty reduction and food security strategies. For individuals and households, access to irrigation reduces the severity of rural poverty by increasing (i) food production, (ii) on-farm employment, and (iii) incomes. The project addresses the three pillars of ADB's country partnership strategy, 2010-2012: (i) broad- based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) governance and capacity building. It builds on lessons learned from past assistance in the agriculture and natural resources sector and complements the interventions of other development partners. The project supports the multisector approach advocated in ADB's Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, as it aims to improve water productivity, access to microfinance, and the application of improved agricultural practices. The project's interventions will be underpinned by associated capacity building at district and community levels. **** Impact **** Agricultural income of rural poor and socially excluded groups is increased. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Poor, women, and other disadvantaged farmers in target communities intensify and diversify their agricultural practices toward higher value crops. Progress Towards Outcome Outputs towards achieving outcome have not yet been started/not yet due. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs WUAs efficiently manage improved irrigation infrastructure. Participating farmers apply improved agriculture practices and have access to microfinance. Government capacity to plan and coordinate small-scale irrigation projects is enhanced. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Till now 168 WUA are Registered. They are having 36% (>33%) female and proportional representation of DAG in membership is complied. Pre-construction training was conducted focusing enhancement of WUA capacity in planning implementation, and operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. Training on water management plan is being provided to WUAs after completion of construction works. WUA of completed subprojects already started to implement. There is WUA commitment at the time of subproject demand and will be complied at the time of completion. It will be assessed only after the completion and operation of the ISPs. RMDC trained MFIs are forming farmers saving & credit groups meeting the target of female participants. Project selection is done according to the project selection criteria by the village leaders. Training plan have been prepared and CIP engineers and sub engineers were trained for project design and implementation. DDC/DTO is coordinating the works with DADO and other district government officials. Provision has been made in the plan and will be executed. Training/Observation tour for LDO/DTO is completed. CIP engineers training are being conducted regularly. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: C Indigenous Peoples: B **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect A Project Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) guides the preparation of environmental due diligence for the subprojects. Environmental due diligence is incorporated into the Feasibility Assessment Reports. In accordance with the EARF, Initial Environmental Examinations will be prepared for irrigation subprojects with 150 ha or more of command area. So far, no subproject more than 150 ha has been demanded by farmers. Involuntary Resettlement No involuntary resettlement will be used in the Project, as the Project's subproject selection criteria requires that the irrigation improvement is desired by the community and WUA members voluntarily donate any small parcels of land needed for irrigation enhancement. A Resettlement Framework has been prepared to ensure the subproject selection criteria have been met, and to clearly identify the triggers, if any, for more comprehensive safeguards (i.e. resettlement plan). Resettlement due diligence is required to be incorporated into each subproject Feasibility Assessment Report, and will document verification that any land required has been given voluntarily, and that nobody is impoverished by the land donation. If more than 5% of anyone's total land holding is donated, the WUAs must negotiate livelihood restitution measures with the affected party. Indigenous Peoples Indigenous peoples (IPs) are not expected to be affected seriously or at all by the Project, whether it is through loss of livelihoods, displacements, or impacts on their social and cultural identity. Impacts on IPs are expected to be positive, as IPs living in subproject areas will benefit from the access to irrigation, increased agricultural yields, and improved food security. The Project's Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework guides the preparation of subprojects to ensure equitable distribution of benefits and to promote development of the IPs and ethnic minorities along with other disadvantaged groups. The Feasibility Assessment Reports must document due diligence on IPs to ensure that there are no adverse effects on IPs and that interventions are designed with greatest possible reduction of poverty among IPs. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Identification of ISPs are done with wide consultation and information dissemination to the farmers at grass root level. Communities are continually consulted at all stage of the ISPs. The project is planning to organize a multistakeholder workshop on the project activities in near future. During Project Implementation The Project has a Consultation and Participation Plan. This plan has been prepared to ensure local ownership of each CIP subproject, ensure inclusion of all types of user stakeholder groups in participation processes and benefit distribution, and to ensure dissemination of results and lessons learned to the wider community, including interested government, NGOs and civil society organizations. The socio-economic survey of each subproject will flag those households requiring support to enhance their meaningful participation in the activities of the project. These groups will receive targeted coaching. The Project Coordination Unit will analyze each sub-project based on its socio- economic profile and suggest targets and methods for participation assistance. They will also provide training support to the field teams in this respect. In order to ensure the project may learn from other relevant activities and vice versa, the Project Coordination Unit will invite government organizations, NGOs and community-based organizations to periodic workshops to discuss project results, and in particular periodic specialized studies on such topics as gender, poverty impact or other case studies. During the inception mission the stakeholder consultation and participation plan prepared at PPTA stage was reviewed and revised.The following have been integrated: targeted participation actions for social preparation, community and WUA meetings, and training events from each of the safeguard documents into the plan.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 17 May 2010     * Fact-finding: 17 May 2010 to 28 May 2010     * Management Review Meeting: 30 Apr 2007     * Approval: 27 Sep 2010     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Food security in Nepal is alarmingly low, with 49% of children under 5 years old stunted, 25% severely stunted, 13% wasted, and 3% severely wasted. The majority of small and marginal farmers cannot achieve their productivity potential since they have unreliable or no access to irrigation water and improved agricultural technology. Small farmers without irrigation include the disadvantaged Dalit, Janajati and Muslim populations who live and cultivate rain-fed land in peripheral water-scarce areas on steep slopes away from fertile and water-rich valleys in the hills and on the fringes of irrigation systems in the plains. Irrigation is key to increasing the production of staple crops to meet the growing gap between agricultural production and the needs of the expanding population and to diversifying and intensifying agriculture to increase on-farm incomes, reduce rural poverty, and increase food security. Irrigation therefore has a critical role to play in Nepal s poverty reduction and food security strategies. For individuals and households, access to irrigation reduces the severity of rural poverty by increasing (i) food production, (ii) on-farm employment, and (iii) incomes. The project addresses the three pillars of ADB's country partnership strategy, 2010-2012: (i) broad- based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) governance and capacity building. It builds on lessons learned from past assistance in the agriculture and natural resources sector and complements the interventions of other development partners. The project supports the multisector approach advocated in ADB's Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, as it aims to improve water productivity, access to microfinance, and the application of improved agricultural practices. The project's interventions will be underpinned by associated capacity building at district and community levels. **** Impact **** Agricultural income of rural poor and socially excluded groups is increased. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Poor, women, and other disadvantaged farmers in target communities intensify and diversify their agricultural practices toward higher value crops. Progress Towards Outcome Outputs towards achieving outcome have not yet been started/not yet due. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs WUAs efficiently manage improved irrigation infrastructure. Participating farmers apply improved agriculture practices and have access to microfinance. Government capacity to plan and coordinate small-scale irrigation projects is enhanced. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Till now 168 WUA are Registered. They are having 36% (>33%) female and proportional representation of DAG in membership is complied. Pre-construction training was conducted focusing enhancement of WUA capacity in planning implementation, and operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. Training on water management plan is being provided to WUAs after completion of construction works. WUA of completed subprojects already started to implement. There is WUA commitment at the time of subproject demand and will be complied at the time of completion. It will be assessed only after the completion and operation of the ISPs. RMDC trained MFIs are forming farmers saving & credit groups meeting the target of female participants. Project selection is done according to the project selection criteria by the village leaders. Training plan have been prepared and CIP engineers and sub engineers were trained for project design and implementation. DDC/DTO is coordinating the works with DADO and other district government officials. Provision has been made in the plan and will be executed. Training/Observation tour for LDO/DTO is completed. CIP engineers training are being conducted regularly. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: C Indigenous Peoples: B **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect A Project Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) guides the preparation of environmental due diligence for the subprojects. Environmental due diligence is incorporated into the Feasibility Assessment Reports. In accordance with the EARF, Initial Environmental Examinations will be prepared for irrigation subprojects with 150 ha or more of command area. So far, no subproject more than 150 ha has been demanded by farmers. Involuntary Resettlement No involuntary resettlement will be used in the Project, as the Project's subproject selection criteria requires that the irrigation improvement is desired by the community and WUA members voluntarily donate any small parcels of land needed for irrigation enhancement. A Resettlement Framework has been prepared to ensure the subproject selection criteria have been met, and to clearly identify the triggers, if any, for more comprehensive safeguards (i.e. resettlement plan). Resettlement due diligence is required to be incorporated into each subproject Feasibility Assessment Report, and will document verification that any land required has been given voluntarily, and that nobody is impoverished by the land donation. If more than 5% of anyone's total land holding is donated, the WUAs must negotiate livelihood restitution measures with the affected party. Indigenous Peoples Indigenous peoples (IPs) are not expected to be affected seriously or at all by the Project, whether it is through loss of livelihoods, displacements, or impacts on their social and cultural identity. Impacts on IPs are expected to be positive, as IPs living in subproject areas will benefit from the access to irrigation, increased agricultural yields, and improved food security. The Project's Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework guides the preparation of subprojects to ensure equitable distribution of benefits and to promote development of the IPs and ethnic minorities along with other disadvantaged groups. The Feasibility Assessment Reports must document due diligence on IPs to ensure that there are no adverse effects on IPs and that interventions are designed with greatest possible reduction of poverty among IPs. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Identification of ISPs are done with wide consultation and information dissemination to the farmers at grass root level. Communities are continually consulted at all stage of the ISPs. The project is planning to organize a multistakeholder workshop on the project activities in near future. During Project Implementation The Project has a Consultation and Participation Plan. This plan has been prepared to ensure local ownership of each CIP subproject, ensure inclusion of all types of user stakeholder groups in participation processes and benefit distribution, and to ensure dissemination of results and lessons learned to the wider community, including interested government, NGOs and civil society organizations. The socio-economic survey of each subproject will flag those households requiring support to enhance their meaningful participation in the activities of the project. These groups will receive targeted coaching. The Project Coordination Unit will analyze each sub-project based on its socio- economic profile and suggest targets and methods for participation assistance. They will also provide training support to the field teams in this respect. In order to ensure the project may learn from other relevant activities and vice versa, the Project Coordination Unit will invite government organizations, NGOs and community-based organizations to periodic workshops to discuss project results, and in particular periodic specialized studies on such topics as gender, poverty impact or other case studies. During the inception mission the stakeholder consultation and participation plan prepared at PPTA stage was reviewed and revised.The following have been integrated: targeted participation actions for social preparation, community and WUA meetings, and training events from each of the safeguard documents into the plan.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 17 May 2010     * Fact-finding: 17 May 2010 to 28 May 2010     * Management Review Meeting: 30 Apr 2007     * Approval: 27 Sep 2010     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

  * Facebook     * Twitter     * LinkedIn     * Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the region with a population of about 24 million people scattered throughout remote mountainous villages. Several structural factors hindering the country?s attempts at development include: (i) the difficult terrain of a mountainous, landlocked country, (ii) low levels of physical infrastructure resulting in many remote areas without connectivity to the rest of the country, and (iii) lack of good governance. An overall level of telephone density for both fixed and cellular services is low. Many villages do not have access to telecoms services. Broadcasting services are not available to all villages. Information and communications technology (ICT) services are limited to major urban areas. The decentralization of economic activities away from Kathmandu Valley is hampered by the lack of basic infrastructure and poor communications system. With these constraints, Nepal has a huge potential to take full advantage of ICT, as it allows distribution of, and access to, information at no cost difference regardless of different spatial distances. Particularly in Nepal, the benefits of e-government will be far more extensive, especially compared with its networking cost. A majority of people living in remote areas could be empowered by ICT to gain access to public services at as affordable a price as enjoyed by people in Kathmandu Valley. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: B Indigenous Peoples: **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Any negative social and environmental impact will be minimal. Social and environmental aspects will be properly addressed. Environmental impact mitigation and land acquisition, if any, will be implemented and strictly monitored.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 07 Oct 2004     * Fact-finding: 27 Mar 2006 to 30 Mar 2006     * Approval: 30 Aug 2006     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

The project outputs include (i) increased public and private investment in commercial agriculture, (ii) inclusion of poor and semicommercial stakeholders in commercial agriculture, (iii) timely availability of market information to farmers, and (iv) enhanced capacity of project partners in supporting farmers. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The Project builds on existing initiatives; responds to the needs of stakeholders; and ensures fairer benefits to poor disadvantaged communities and women. The Project is timely and based on sound experience; its design is consistent with ADB?s strategic focus under the CSP to (i) increase agricultural productivity (ii) increase agricultural income and employment opportunities for rural people, and (iii) increase commercialization of agriculture. ADB?s 2005?2009 country strategy and program (CSP) for Nepal links future ADB assistance to results sought by the Government to deal with the underlying causes and possible long-term effects of the recent conflict. Broad- based and inclusive social and economic development to achieve a steady decline in poverty is the adopted strategy. The results are in line with the objectives of the Government?s poverty reduction strategy (Tenth Five-Year Plan), which is built on four pillars: (i) broad-based and higher economic growth, (ii) social development, (iii) targeted programs for socially excluded groups, and (iv) good governance. The main thrusts of the CSP are (i) promoting greater development balance in different regions; (ii) improving access of the poor to basic services, opportunities for social advancement, and participation in the development process; and (iii) addressing the needs of disadvantaged ethnic groups, castes, and women. In project design, the CSP requires (i) simple design, (ii) service delivery through local stakeholders, (iii) demand-driven assistance, (iv) results-focused support, (v) flexible implementation modalities, (vi) community participation with social inclusion in overall project implementation, and (vii) greater transparency and accountability. These requirements guided design of the Project and are incorporated in its framework. **** Impact **** Reduced poverty in the rural communities of 11 districts in the Eastern Development Region (EDR) of Nepal through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Improved efficiency of marketing and processing high-value crops (HVCs) such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR Progress Towards Outcome Project implementation completed on 30 June 2013.

The environmental safeguards are incorporated in subproject concept notes (SCN) and subproject detail proposals. Implementation is being monitored by environment consultant, district-based CAA monitoring officers and district technical office (DTO) staff. The adherence to labor-based approach, disposal of spoil, drainage management, replantation for cleared trees, protection from erosion, and encroachment of private land are a few important issues require carefully screened and addressed in subprojects. Infrastructure built under the Project are engineered and supervised for quality control by DTO and PMU engineers and users committees. It was agreed to intensify environmental monitoring in project implementation; avoid use of private property or submit as an annex to SCN a consent letter signed by owners and endorsed by village development committee or an independent NGO confirming that lands were donated voluntarily to subproject; prohibit use of heavy equipment for construction works and adopt labor-based approach; replant cleared trees at 1:25 ratio; carefully implement integrated pest management; and select subprojects based on priority. It was also agreed to increase technical staff for timely preparation, implementation monitoring and quality control of infrastructure subprojects. The quarterly progress report will include a section on status of environmental safeguards compliance in infrastructure and non-infrastructure subprojects. Involuntary Resettlement There is community infrastructure included in the commercial agriculture packages but no proposal from the beneficiaries has been accepted that might involve involuntary resettlement. However, the resettlement component is reflected in each of the proposal selection criteria. While selection of subprojects, the Project is carefully considering that no person is adversely affected due to land acquisition, resettlement or land donation and in terms of ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the prevailing laws and regulations of the country. Indigenous Peoples The Project has no negative impact on indigenous people. The Project has been addressing the issues of social and economic exclusion through its component 2: inclusive development of stakeholders, which assists disadvantaged people and poor subsistence farmers to develop and participate in income-generating agricultural activities. Social Development Specialist at PMU has been assisting in ensuring the equitable distribution of project resources and equal access to project activities and structures. The associated JFPR grant targets and benefits the most disadvantaged people by focusing on building their capacity and on income generation opportunities through a specialized package of targeted support to ensure their participation. The Project has made a considerable progress in achieving the targets. Out of 274 CAA members, women comprise 48%, dalit 6%, janajati 41%, and others4 53%, which meets the GAP target. Of the total CAA members, farmer groups are 47%, cooperatives 32%, traders 11%, and processors 10%. Out of the total farmer groups, women only groups are 12%, while women only cooperatives are 20%. Rest of the farmer groups and cooperatives has women and men members. The traders (16) and processors (13) are mostly male groups. Of the total 25,144 subsistence and semi-commercial members, women are in high numbers 66% subsistence and 51% semi-commercial. Similarly, representation of dalit (26%) and janajati (53%) are also high in subsistence groups. The Project has institutionalized the systemic collection of disaggregated data from the field to centre, and proper formats have been used for periodic monitoring and reporting. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Participatory design workshops with stakeholders conducted at several stages during PPTA implementation. During Project Implementation The Project will reduce rural poverty in the EDR through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. Impacts include increased economic activities and jobs in the project area. Social inclusion activities will promote the participation of all stakeholders including the poor, disadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; help them receive fair benefits from such participation; and in turn contribute to restoring peace and stability in the EDR. The Project will directly generate employment opportunities for subsistence stakeholders by promoting HVC production and marketing, transporting products from the field to storage and processing centers, and assisting small-scale community-based market infrastructure development. The landless poor will, through skill-based training, be made more employable and capable of income generation. Commercial stakeholders will be assisted to add value to agriculture products and encouraged to adopt socially inclusive behavior to help the less advantaged. **** Status of Covenants **** Category                     Rating Grant 0063 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     &ndash; Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         Satisfactory Project Financial Statements &ndash;   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program.

***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The Project will reduce poverty in the rural communities of 11 EDR districts through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. The project outcome will be improved efficiency of production, marketing, and processing of HVCs such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR. The project outputs include (i) increased public and private investment in commercial agriculture, (ii) inclusion of poor and semicommercial stakeholders in commercial agriculture, (iii) timely availability of market information to farmers, and (iv) enhanced capacity of project partners in supporting farmers. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The Project builds on existing initiatives; responds to the needs of stakeholders; and ensures fairer benefits to poor disadvantaged communities and women. The Project is timely and based on sound experience; its design is consistent with ADB?s strategic focus under the CSP to (i) increase agricultural productivity (ii) increase agricultural income and employment opportunities for rural people, and (iii) increase commercialization of agriculture. ADB?s 2005?2009 country strategy and program (CSP) for Nepal links future ADB assistance to results sought by the Government to deal with the underlying causes and possible long-term effects of the recent conflict. Broad- based and inclusive social and economic development to achieve a steady decline in poverty is the adopted strategy. The results are in line with the objectives of the Government?s poverty reduction strategy (Tenth Five-Year Plan), which is built on four pillars: (i) broad-based and higher economic growth, (ii) social development, (iii) targeted programs for socially excluded groups, and (iv) good governance. The main thrusts of the CSP are (i) promoting greater development balance in different regions; (ii) improving access of the poor to basic services, opportunities for social advancement, and participation in the development process; and (iii) addressing the needs of disadvantaged ethnic groups, castes, and women. In project design, the CSP requires (i) simple design, (ii) service delivery through local stakeholders, (iii) demand-driven assistance, (iv) results-focused support, (v) flexible implementation modalities, (vi) community participation with social inclusion in overall project implementation, and (vii) greater transparency and accountability. These requirements guided design of the Project and are incorporated in its framework. **** Impact **** Reduced poverty in the rural communities of 11 districts in the Eastern Development Region (EDR) of Nepal through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Improved efficiency of marketing and processing high-value crops (HVCs) such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR Progress Towards Outcome Project implementation completed on 30 June 2013.

The environmental safeguards are incorporated in subproject concept notes (SCN) and subproject detail proposals. Implementation is being monitored by environment consultant, district-based CAA monitoring officers and district technical office (DTO) staff. The adherence to labor-based approach, disposal of spoil, drainage management, replantation for cleared trees, protection from erosion, and encroachment of private land are a few important issues require carefully screened and addressed in subprojects. Infrastructure built under the Project are engineered and supervised for quality control by DTO and PMU engineers and users committees. It was agreed to intensify environmental monitoring in project implementation; avoid use of private property or submit as an annex to SCN a consent letter signed by owners and endorsed by village development committee or an independent NGO confirming that lands were donated voluntarily to subproject; prohibit use of heavy equipment for construction works and adopt labor-based approach; replant cleared trees at 1:25 ratio; carefully implement integrated pest management; and select subprojects based on priority. It was also agreed to increase technical staff for timely preparation, implementation monitoring and quality control of infrastructure subprojects. The quarterly progress report will include a section on status of environmental safeguards compliance in infrastructure and non-infrastructure subprojects. Involuntary Resettlement There is community infrastructure included in the commercial agriculture packages but no proposal from the beneficiaries has been accepted that might involve involuntary resettlement. However, the resettlement component is reflected in each of the proposal selection criteria. While selection of subprojects, the Project is carefully considering that no person is adversely affected due to land acquisition, resettlement or land donation and in terms of ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the prevailing laws and regulations of the country. Indigenous Peoples The Project has no negative impact on indigenous people. The Project has been addressing the issues of social and economic exclusion through its component 2: inclusive development of stakeholders, which assists disadvantaged people and poor subsistence farmers to develop and participate in income-generating agricultural activities. Social Development Specialist at PMU has been assisting in ensuring the equitable distribution of project resources and equal access to project activities and structures. The associated JFPR grant targets and benefits the most disadvantaged people by focusing on building their capacity and on income generation opportunities through a specialized package of targeted support to ensure their participation. The Project has made a considerable progress in achieving the targets. Out of 274 CAA members, women comprise 48%, dalit 6%, janajati 41%, and others4 53%, which meets the GAP target. Of the total CAA members, farmer groups are 47%, cooperatives 32%, traders 11%, and processors 10%. Out of the total farmer groups, women only groups are 12%, while women only cooperatives are 20%. Rest of the farmer groups and cooperatives has women and men members. The traders (16) and processors (13) are mostly male groups. Of the total 25,144 subsistence and semi-commercial members, women are in high numbers 66% subsistence and 51% semi-commercial. Similarly, representation of dalit (26%) and janajati (53%) are also high in subsistence groups. The Project has institutionalized the systemic collection of disaggregated data from the field to centre, and proper formats have been used for periodic monitoring and reporting. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Participatory design workshops with stakeholders conducted at several stages during PPTA implementation. During Project Implementation The Project will reduce rural poverty in the EDR through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. Impacts include increased economic activities and jobs in the project area. Social inclusion activities will promote the participation of all stakeholders including the poor, disadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; help them receive fair benefits from such participation; and in turn contribute to restoring peace and stability in the EDR. The Project will directly generate employment opportunities for subsistence stakeholders by promoting HVC production and marketing, transporting products from the field to storage and processing centers, and assisting small-scale community-based market infrastructure development. The landless poor will, through skill-based training, be made more employable and capable of income generation. Commercial stakeholders will be assisted to add value to agriculture products and encouraged to adopt socially inclusive behavior to help the less advantaged. **** Status of Covenants **** Category                     Rating Grant 0063 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     &ndash; Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         Satisfactory Project Financial Statements &ndash;   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program.

***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The Project will reduce poverty in the rural communities of 11 EDR districts through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. The project outcome will be improved efficiency of production, marketing, and processing of HVCs such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR. The project outputs include (i) increased public and private investment in commercial agriculture, (ii) inclusion of poor and semicommercial stakeholders in commercial agriculture, (iii) timely availability of market information to farmers, and (iv) enhanced capacity of project partners in supporting farmers. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The Project builds on existing initiatives; responds to the needs of stakeholders; and ensures fairer benefits to poor disadvantaged communities and women. The Project is timely and based on sound experience; its design is consistent with ADB?s strategic focus under the CSP to (i) increase agricultural productivity (ii) increase agricultural income and employment opportunities for rural people, and (iii) increase commercialization of agriculture. ADB?s 2005?2009 country strategy and program (CSP) for Nepal links future ADB assistance to results sought by the Government to deal with the underlying causes and possible long-term effects of the recent conflict. Broad- based and inclusive social and economic development to achieve a steady decline in poverty is the adopted strategy. The results are in line with the objectives of the Government?s poverty reduction strategy (Tenth Five-Year Plan), which is built on four pillars: (i) broad-based and higher economic growth, (ii) social development, (iii) targeted programs for socially excluded groups, and (iv) good governance. The main thrusts of the CSP are (i) promoting greater development balance in different regions; (ii) improving access of the poor to basic services, opportunities for social advancement, and participation in the development process; and (iii) addressing the needs of disadvantaged ethnic groups, castes, and women. In project design, the CSP requires (i) simple design, (ii) service delivery through local stakeholders, (iii) demand-driven assistance, (iv) results-focused support, (v) flexible implementation modalities, (vi) community participation with social inclusion in overall project implementation, and (vii) greater transparency and accountability. These requirements guided design of the Project and are incorporated in its framework. **** Impact **** Reduced poverty in the rural communities of 11 districts in the Eastern Development Region (EDR) of Nepal through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Improved efficiency of marketing and processing high-value crops (HVCs) such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices in the EDR Progress Towards Outcome Project implementation completed on 30 June 2013.

The environmental safeguards are incorporated in subproject concept notes (SCN) and subproject detail proposals. Implementation is being monitored by environment consultant, district-based CAA monitoring officers and district technical office (DTO) staff. The adherence to labor-based approach, disposal of spoil, drainage management, replantation for cleared trees, protection from erosion, and encroachment of private land are a few important issues require carefully screened and addressed in subprojects. Infrastructure built under the Project are engineered and supervised for quality control by DTO and PMU engineers and users committees. It was agreed to intensify environmental monitoring in project implementation; avoid use of private property or submit as an annex to SCN a consent letter signed by owners and endorsed by village development committee or an independent NGO confirming that lands were donated voluntarily to subproject; prohibit use of heavy equipment for construction works and adopt labor-based approach; replant cleared trees at 1:25 ratio; carefully implement integrated pest management; and select subprojects based on priority. It was also agreed to increase technical staff for timely preparation, implementation monitoring and quality control of infrastructure subprojects. The quarterly progress report will include a section on status of environmental safeguards compliance in infrastructure and non-infrastructure subprojects. Involuntary Resettlement There is community infrastructure included in the commercial agriculture packages but no proposal from the beneficiaries has been accepted that might involve involuntary resettlement. However, the resettlement component is reflected in each of the proposal selection criteria. While selection of subprojects, the Project is carefully considering that no person is adversely affected due to land acquisition, resettlement or land donation and in terms of ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the prevailing laws and regulations of the country. Indigenous Peoples The Project has no negative impact on indigenous people. The Project has been addressing the issues of social and economic exclusion through its component 2: inclusive development of stakeholders, which assists disadvantaged people and poor subsistence farmers to develop and participate in income-generating agricultural activities. Social Development Specialist at PMU has been assisting in ensuring the equitable distribution of project resources and equal access to project activities and structures. The associated JFPR grant targets and benefits the most disadvantaged people by focusing on building their capacity and on income generation opportunities through a specialized package of targeted support to ensure their participation. The Project has made a considerable progress in achieving the targets. Out of 274 CAA members, women comprise 48%, dalit 6%, janajati 41%, and others4 53%, which meets the GAP target. Of the total CAA members, farmer groups are 47%, cooperatives 32%, traders 11%, and processors 10%. Out of the total farmer groups, women only groups are 12%, while women only cooperatives are 20%. Rest of the farmer groups and cooperatives has women and men members. The traders (16) and processors (13) are mostly male groups. Of the total 25,144 subsistence and semi-commercial members, women are in high numbers 66% subsistence and 51% semi-commercial. Similarly, representation of dalit (26%) and janajati (53%) are also high in subsistence groups. The Project has institutionalized the systemic collection of disaggregated data from the field to centre, and proper formats have been used for periodic monitoring and reporting. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Participatory design workshops with stakeholders conducted at several stages during PPTA implementation. During Project Implementation The Project will reduce rural poverty in the EDR through equitable and sustainable commercialization of agriculture. Impacts include increased economic activities and jobs in the project area. Social inclusion activities will promote the participation of all stakeholders including the poor, disadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; help them receive fair benefits from such participation; and in turn contribute to restoring peace and stability in the EDR. The Project will directly generate employment opportunities for subsistence stakeholders by promoting HVC production and marketing, transporting products from the field to storage and processing centers, and assisting small-scale community-based market infrastructure development. The landless poor will, through skill-based training, be made more employable and capable of income generation. Commercial stakeholders will be assisted to add value to agriculture products and encouraged to adopt socially inclusive behavior to help the less advantaged. **** Status of Covenants **** Category                     Rating Grant 0063 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     &ndash; Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         Satisfactory Project Financial Statements &ndash;   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program.

 * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The proposed loan and grants will directly address the urgent needs attributed to the electricity supply crisis in Nepal, through rehabilitation of two hydropower plants, supply-side energy efficiency, and demand-side management. The transmission network strengthening will also add supply capacity by increasing evacuation of power from hydropower stations in the western region and allow increased energy imports across the western border in the short term. In the medium term, the transmission network strengthening will allow cross- border energy exports, while distribution strengthening will facilitate additional consumer connections and increased energy efficiency. PPPs in distribution will help the NEA to pilot private sector involvement in improving distribution efficiency. These project interventions will also lead to improved financial performance of the NEA and sustainability of the sector through increased revenues, reduced losses, and improved efficiency. **** Impact **** Increased access to electricity across the country **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Reliable and energy efficient power supply with increased access and operational efficiency in the project areas. Progress Towards Outcome The works are ongoing and the outcome is likely to be achieved. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs 1.

RFP for 2 distribution centers to be floated by Dec 2014. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: Indigenous Peoples: **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect The Government of Nepal has undertaken initial environmental examinations and developed an environmental management plan for all relevant packages and included in the bidding/contract documents. Involuntary Resettlement A full resettlement plan (RP) was prepared during project preparation in consultation with affected parties, local authorities, and the NEA, in accordance with ADB s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The project requires a total of 4.66 ha of land for permanent acquisition and 21.39 ha land requires restriction of use for TL right of way (ROW).However, the routing of transmission line is slightly changed during implementation of 1 package to reduce the impacts. Thus EA is currently in the process to update the RP. Indigenous Peoples No adverse impact is expected on indigenous people s communities. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Consultation with NEA officials was focused to solicit project-related data and documents and to gather further information required for project preparation activities. District stakeholders were consulted to inform them about the project, collect required information and suggestions relevant to the project, and seek their support tor project preparation. Consultation with the local community, including the project-affected families, was undertaken to (i) disseminate information about the proposed projects and likely impacts, (ii) solicit their view and suggestion, (iii) collect socioeconomic and census data, (iv) assess the scope of effects on private and community assets, (v) financial assistance to be made to the affected people. During Project Implementation Regular review missions and regular meetings are conducted by ADB. **** Status of Covenants **** Category                     Rating Loan 2587 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     Satisfactory Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash; Grant 0182 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     Satisfactory Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash; Grant 0183 Sector                       &ndash; Social                       &ndash; Financial                    &ndash; Economic                     &ndash; Others                       &ndash; Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash;   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program.

Efficiency Improvement Project ******     * Facebook     * Twitter     * LinkedIn     * Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The proposed loan and grants will directly address the urgent needs attributed to the electricity supply crisis in Nepal, through rehabilitation of two hydropower plants, supply-side energy efficiency, and demand-side management. The transmission network strengthening will also add supply capacity by increasing evacuation of power from hydropower stations in the western region and allow increased energy imports across the western border in the short term. In the medium term, the transmission network strengthening will allow cross- border energy exports, while distribution strengthening will facilitate additional consumer connections and increased energy efficiency. PPPs in distribution will help the NEA to pilot private sector involvement in improving distribution efficiency. These project interventions will also lead to improved financial performance of the NEA and sustainability of the sector through increased revenues, reduced losses, and improved efficiency. **** Impact **** Increased access to electricity across the country **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Reliable and energy efficient power supply with increased access and operational efficiency in the project areas. Progress Towards Outcome The works are ongoing and the outcome is likely to be achieved. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs 1.

Involuntary Resettlement A full resettlement plan (RP) was prepared during project preparation in consultation with affected parties, local authorities, and the NEA, in accordance with ADB s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The project requires a total of 4.66 ha of land for permanent acquisition and 21.39 ha land requires restriction of use for TL right of way (ROW).However, the routing of transmission line is slightly changed during implementation of 1 package to reduce the impacts. Thus EA is currently in the process to update the RP. Indigenous Peoples No adverse impact is expected on indigenous people s communities. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Consultation with NEA officials was focused to solicit project-related data and documents and to gather further information required for project preparation activities. District stakeholders were consulted to inform them about the project, collect required information and suggestions relevant to the project, and seek their support tor project preparation. Consultation with the local community, including the project-affected families, was undertaken to (i) disseminate information about the proposed projects and likely impacts, (ii) solicit their view and suggestion, (iii) collect socioeconomic and census data, (iv) assess the scope of effects on private and community assets, (v) financial assistance to be made to the affected people. During Project Implementation Regular review missions and regular meetings are conducted by ADB. **** Status of Covenants **** Category                     Rating Loan 2587 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     Satisfactory Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash; Grant 0182 Sector                       Satisfactory Social                       Satisfactory Financial                    Satisfactory Economic                     Satisfactory Others                       Satisfactory Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash; Grant 0183 Sector                       &ndash; Social                       &ndash; Financial                    &ndash; Economic                     &ndash; Others                       &ndash; Safe                         &ndash; Project Financial Statements &ndash;   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program.

Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative. The Public_Communications_Policy_(PCP) recognizes that transparency and accountability are essential to development effectiveness. It establishes the disclosure requirements for documents and information ADB produces or requires to be produced. The Accountability_Mechanism provides a forum where people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can voice and seek solutions to their problems and report alleged noncompliance of ADB's operational policies and procedures.

Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The TA supports ADB's Energy for All Initiative, which develops new approaches for scaling up access to energy for the poor, in line with ADB's commitment to inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. The TA will pilot test the SMB approach to increase the number of improved water mills by helping poor households gain access to local financing, technology, and know-how to enable financially viable but nonbankable projects to become bankable. The key feature of the SMB approach is the establishment of a revolving fund to provide a menu of ""gap-filling"" finance (e.g., equity, debt, bridge financing, lease-toward- purchase, and partial credit guarantees) to entrepreneurs to mobilize local financing for income-generating, small-scale energy investments. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** ADB's country strategy and program (CSP) for Nepal is focused on providing access to economic opportunities to foster-based growth, with a special focus on the needs of the poor and excluded in rural areas. **** Impact **** Access to sustainable, reliable and affordable modern energy services improved in target communities in Nepal **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Results of social merchant banking (SMB) approach to financing improved water mills demonstrate the viability of scaling up access to energy projects Progress Towards Outcome Implementation is ongoing. The TA consultants have identified geographical areas to benefit from SMB financing through the IWM program. These will be engaged and targeted upon the establishment of the revolving fund. The Clean Energy Development Bank (CEDB) was selected as the host of the revolving fund through competitive procedure and pursuant to the criteria stipulated in the TA. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs SMB model piloted in some IWMP districts Capacity built among local partners, e.g., entrepreneurs and microfinance and financial institutions, to implement sustainable energy service delivery programs Revolving fund capitalized and deployed on a pilot basis to provide gap-filling finance for energy service investments. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Both the international consultant, with direct experience in applying the social merchant banking approach, and the national consulting firm - CRT/N are officially on board. Minor changes in implementation arrangement were approved by Director, SAEN on 26 Feb 2013 to reflect the following: (i) CEBD as the host of the revolving fund; (ii) APF in lieu of IA; (iii) reallocation of TA funds; and (iv) extension of TA closing till 30 Oct 2013. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Consultation with project stakeholders will be an important part of project implementation. These will be consulted through design and into implementation. During Project Implementation Consultation with stakeholders will continue throughout implementation of the project.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.

***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The pace of urbanization in Nepal has increased markedly during 2001 2011 with an urban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national population growth of 1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was estimated to live in urban areas, up from 9.2% in 1991 and 13.9% in 2001. While global experience clearly demonstrates that urbanization is an important driver of economic development, the potential has not been adequately tapped in Nepal. In the absence of a stringent policy regulating and managing growth, uncontrolled and haphazard urban development has created numerous problems, including deficiencies in basic urban services; environmental degradation; encroachment on public land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement development. Most municipalities in Nepal lack properly engineered and operated sanitary landfills, and have limited and intermittent water supply services, poorly maintained road infrastructure, and inadequate drainage systems that cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai. The Local Self Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to municipalities, but the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a low level of institutional capacity make providing infrastructure facilities commensurate with the growing demand for services a major challenge. Poor health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by reducing labor productivity and educational attainment. Disease, associated economic burden, and premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable. **** Impact **** Improved urban environment in the municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Population in project municipalities have inclusively better access to improved municipal infrastructure and services. Progress Towards Outcome There are 10 consulting service packages in total: project management and support consultant (PMSC) in the PCO; GESI consultant for the GESI Unit; design and supervision consultants (DSCs) for the four project municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar; and local nongovernment organization (NGO) services in the four project municipalities. Contracts have been awarded for all. Technical Bid Evaluation for the drainage and road subprojects at Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar is in stage of finalization at PCO. ADB has already provided no objection to issue IFB for SWM projects at Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj. Design and Bid document of Dharan water supply project has been finalised. Similarly the design of the drainage and road project at Janakpur has been finalized and draft bidding document has been prepared. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs 1. Reliable municipal infrastructure developed 2. Community development programs undertaken and GESI capacity strengthened. 3. Project management and administration supported. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress TBER of the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj drainage and road subprojects are in final stage at PCO. Final design and draft bidding document of Janakpur drainage and road subproject has been prepared. Progress mentioned above. ADB has already provided concurrence to issue IFB for the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj SWM Subprojects. Regarding Janakpur SWM sub project, site has not yet been finalized due to social issues. To early to report. Design and Bid document has been finalised with a target to publish IFB by end of Oct 2014. Progress mentioned above. Project implementation is being done in this direction by mobilizing NGOs in Dharan, Janakpur, Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj Municpalities. 84 TLOs and 3 Users committee formed have more than 33% of women representatives. Community developement proposals will adreess this issue. GESI operational guidelines is finalized and toolkits developed for the same. Log frame of GESI project is prepared. This has been done. PCO and PIUs formed and core staff appointed. Aduit report and quarterly reports are being submitted timely. Being complied though there is some delay in Janakpur sub projects. Implementaion ongoing in this direction. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: B Indigenous Peoples: C **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect The project is classified as environmental category B. Four initial environmental examinations including environmental management plans were prepared in accordance with ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws, and disclosed. Subprojects are not located in or near sensitive or protected areas, and the initial environmental examinations conclude that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management plans provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of short duration. The net environmental benefits will be positive and large, including reduced (i) urban flooding from improved drainage systems, (ii) environmental pollution from improved SWM, and (iii) health and hygiene status as well as the overall environmental sanitation situation of the selected povery clusters of the project municipalities will be improved through various software and hardware activities under small scale community infrastructure. Implementation arrangements in the PCO build on experience gained through ADB urban projects, and consultant support will enable the PIUs to manage environmental impacts. The PCO will provide environmental reports to ADB semiannually. The project had alredy submitted Semi annual environmental safeguard monitorting report covering the period of Jan-June 2014. This has recently been disclosed in ADB's web site. Involuntary Resettlement The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Three draft resettlement plans were prepared in consultation with affected persons in accordance with the ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed. The project requires minor land acquisition for construction of sanitary landfills and temporary impacts on vendors during construction, with no significant resettlement impacts anticipated. Special assistance measures will be made available to vulnerable groups. The resettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO, and adequate consultant inputs have been made available to support implementation and build capacity to managing resettlement impacts and social risks. The project has been reporting compliance to social safeguard related issues by the PIUs in the quarterly as well as semi anuual social safeguard monitoring report to the ADB. The third semi annual safeguard monitoring report covering the period of Jan-June 2014 has already been submitted. Indigenous Peoples The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Considering the urban locations of these subprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Urban services are limited outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations restrict further development in the valley, and there is an urgent need to improve the environment in potential urban centers to promote social and economic development in other regions of Nepal. The government, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the basis of (i) economic growth potential, (ii) demand for urban services, and (iii) urban management capacity. The project directly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP and Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work as catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the employment-centric, equitable, and inclusive economic growth emphasized by the approach paper. Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differentials in the needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets experience discrimination based on gender, caste, and ethnicity, and multiple exclusions constrain their progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is limited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress has been made through support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development partners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. During Project Implementation The project is in line with the Nepal country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity building, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. Reflecting lessons from similar projects, the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically integrated components, to simplify project administration and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable development impacts; (iii) fully involves stakeholders, including communities, in project identification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before project implementation; and (v) addresses enforcement of appropriate regulations as an essential element of managing urban infrastructure effectively. Therefore as envisioned by the Project, the project coordination office and project implementation units are doing consultation with the concerned stakeholders as and when needed and also been disseminating the relevant project related information to the public. Also due consideration has been given for the meaningful participation of the concerned project stakeholders in reaching project related decisions.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Inforation about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 15 Dec 2010     * Fact-finding: 24 Aug 2011 to 06 Sep 2011     * Management Review Meeting: 06 Oct 2011     * Approval: 14 Feb 2012     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

Development Project ******     * Facebook     * Twitter     * LinkedIn     * Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The pace of urbanization in Nepal has increased markedly during 2001 2011 with an urban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national population growth of 1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was estimated to live in urban areas, up from 9.2% in 1991 and 13.9% in 2001. While global experience clearly demonstrates that urbanization is an important driver of economic development, the potential has not been adequately tapped in Nepal. In the absence of a stringent policy regulating and managing growth, uncontrolled and haphazard urban development has created numerous problems, including deficiencies in basic urban services; environmental degradation; encroachment on public land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement development. Most municipalities in Nepal lack properly engineered and operated sanitary landfills, and have limited and intermittent water supply services, poorly maintained road infrastructure, and inadequate drainage systems that cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai. The Local Self Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to municipalities, but the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a low level of institutional capacity make providing infrastructure facilities commensurate with the growing demand for services a major challenge. Poor health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by reducing labor productivity and educational attainment. Disease, associated economic burden, and premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable. **** Impact **** Improved urban environment in the municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Population in project municipalities have inclusively better access to improved municipal infrastructure and services. Progress Towards Outcome There are 10 consulting service packages in total: project management and support consultant (PMSC) in the PCO; GESI consultant for the GESI Unit; design and supervision consultants (DSCs) for the four project municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar; and local nongovernment organization (NGO) services in the four project municipalities. Contracts have been awarded for all. Technical Bid Evaluation for the drainage and road subprojects at Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar is in stage of finalization at PCO. ADB has already provided no objection to issue IFB for SWM projects at Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj. Design and Bid document of Dharan water supply project has been finalised. Similarly the design of the drainage and road project at Janakpur has been finalized and draft bidding document has been prepared. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs 1. Reliable municipal infrastructure developed 2. Community development programs undertaken and GESI capacity strengthened. 3. Project management and administration supported. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress TBER of the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj drainage and road subprojects are in final stage at PCO. Final design and draft bidding document of Janakpur drainage and road subproject has been prepared. Progress mentioned above. ADB has already provided concurrence to issue IFB for the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj SWM Subprojects. Regarding Janakpur SWM sub project, site has not yet been finalized due to social issues. To early to report. Design and Bid document has been finalised with a target to publish IFB by end of Oct 2014. Progress mentioned above. Project implementation is being done in this direction by mobilizing NGOs in Dharan, Janakpur, Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj Municpalities. 84 TLOs and 3 Users committee formed have more than 33% of women representatives. Community developement proposals will adreess this issue. GESI operational guidelines is finalized and toolkits developed for the same. Log frame of GESI project is prepared. This has been done. PCO and PIUs formed and core staff appointed. Aduit report and quarterly reports are being submitted timely. Being complied though there is some delay in Janakpur sub projects. Implementaion ongoing in this direction. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: B Indigenous Peoples: C **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect The project is classified as environmental category B. Four initial environmental examinations including environmental management plans were prepared in accordance with ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws, and disclosed. Subprojects are not located in or near sensitive or protected areas, and the initial environmental examinations conclude that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management plans provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of short duration. The net environmental benefits will be positive and large, including reduced (i) urban flooding from improved drainage systems, (ii) environmental pollution from improved SWM, and (iii) health and hygiene status as well as the overall environmental sanitation situation of the selected povery clusters of the project municipalities will be improved through various software and hardware activities under small scale community infrastructure. Implementation arrangements in the PCO build on experience gained through ADB urban projects, and consultant support will enable the PIUs to manage environmental impacts. The PCO will provide environmental reports to ADB semiannually. The project had alredy submitted Semi annual environmental safeguard monitorting report covering the period of Jan-June 2014. This has recently been disclosed in ADB's web site. Involuntary Resettlement The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Three draft resettlement plans were prepared in consultation with affected persons in accordance with the ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed. The project requires minor land acquisition for construction of sanitary landfills and temporary impacts on vendors during construction, with no significant resettlement impacts anticipated. Special assistance measures will be made available to vulnerable groups. The resettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO, and adequate consultant inputs have been made available to support implementation and build capacity to managing resettlement impacts and social risks. The project has been reporting compliance to social safeguard related issues by the PIUs in the quarterly as well as semi anuual social safeguard monitoring report to the ADB. The third semi annual safeguard monitoring report covering the period of Jan-June 2014 has already been submitted. Indigenous Peoples The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Considering the urban locations of these subprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Urban services are limited outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations restrict further development in the valley, and there is an urgent need to improve the environment in potential urban centers to promote social and economic development in other regions of Nepal. The government, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the basis of (i) economic growth potential, (ii) demand for urban services, and (iii) urban management capacity. The project directly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP and Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work as catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the employment-centric, equitable, and inclusive economic growth emphasized by the approach paper. Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differentials in the needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets experience discrimination based on gender, caste, and ethnicity, and multiple exclusions constrain their progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is limited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress has been made through support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development partners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. During Project Implementation The project is in line with the Nepal country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity building, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. Reflecting lessons from similar projects, the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically integrated components, to simplify project administration and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable development impacts; (iii) fully involves stakeholders, including communities, in project identification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before project implementation; and (v) addresses enforcement of appropriate regulations as an essential element of managing urban infrastructure effectively. Therefore as envisioned by the Project, the project coordination office and project implementation units are doing consultation with the concerned stakeholders as and when needed and also been disseminating the relevant project related information to the public. Also due consideration has been given for the meaningful participation of the concerned project stakeholders in reaching project related decisions.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Inforation about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 15 Dec 2010     * Fact-finding: 24 Aug 2011 to 06 Sep 2011     * Management Review Meeting: 06 Oct 2011     * Approval: 14 Feb 2012     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

Development Project ******     * Facebook     * Twitter     * LinkedIn     * Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The pace of urbanization in Nepal has increased markedly during 2001 2011 with an urban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national population growth of 1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was estimated to live in urban areas, up from 9.2% in 1991 and 13.9% in 2001. While global experience clearly demonstrates that urbanization is an important driver of economic development, the potential has not been adequately tapped in Nepal. In the absence of a stringent policy regulating and managing growth, uncontrolled and haphazard urban development has created numerous problems, including deficiencies in basic urban services; environmental degradation; encroachment on public land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement development. Most municipalities in Nepal lack properly engineered and operated sanitary landfills, and have limited and intermittent water supply services, poorly maintained road infrastructure, and inadequate drainage systems that cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai. The Local Self Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to municipalities, but the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a low level of institutional capacity make providing infrastructure facilities commensurate with the growing demand for services a major challenge. Poor health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by reducing labor productivity and educational attainment. Disease, associated economic burden, and premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable. **** Impact **** Improved urban environment in the municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Population in project municipalities have inclusively better access to improved municipal infrastructure and services. Progress Towards Outcome There are 10 consulting service packages in total: project management and support consultant (PMSC) in the PCO; GESI consultant for the GESI Unit; design and supervision consultants (DSCs) for the four project municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar; and local nongovernment organization (NGO) services in the four project municipalities. Contracts have been awarded for all. Technical Bid Evaluation for the drainage and road subprojects at Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar is in stage of finalization at PCO. ADB has already provided no objection to issue IFB for SWM projects at Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj. Design and Bid document of Dharan water supply project has been finalised. Similarly the design of the drainage and road project at Janakpur has been finalized and draft bidding document has been prepared. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs 1. Reliable municipal infrastructure developed 2. Community development programs undertaken and GESI capacity strengthened. 3. Project management and administration supported. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress TBER of the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj drainage and road subprojects are in final stage at PCO. Final design and draft bidding document of Janakpur drainage and road subproject has been prepared. Progress mentioned above. ADB has already provided concurrence to issue IFB for the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj SWM Subprojects. Regarding Janakpur SWM sub project, site has not yet been finalized due to social issues. To early to report. Design and Bid document has been finalised with a target to publish IFB by end of Oct 2014. Progress mentioned above. Project implementation is being done in this direction by mobilizing NGOs in Dharan, Janakpur, Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj Municpalities. 84 TLOs and 3 Users committee formed have more than 33% of women representatives. Community developement proposals will adreess this issue. GESI operational guidelines is finalized and toolkits developed for the same. Log frame of GESI project is prepared. This has been done. PCO and PIUs formed and core staff appointed. Aduit report and quarterly reports are being submitted timely. Being complied though there is some delay in Janakpur sub projects. Implementaion ongoing in this direction. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: B Indigenous Peoples: C **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect The project is classified as environmental category B. Four initial environmental examinations including environmental management plans were prepared in accordance with ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws, and disclosed. Subprojects are not located in or near sensitive or protected areas, and the initial environmental examinations conclude that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management plans provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of short duration. The net environmental benefits will be positive and large, including reduced (i) urban flooding from improved drainage systems, (ii) environmental pollution from improved SWM, and (iii) health and hygiene status as well as the overall environmental sanitation situation of the selected povery clusters of the project municipalities will be improved through various software and hardware activities under small scale community infrastructure. Implementation arrangements in the PCO build on experience gained through ADB urban projects, and consultant support will enable the PIUs to manage environmental impacts. The PCO will provide environmental reports to ADB semiannually. The project had alredy submitted Semi annual environmental safeguard monitorting report covering the period of Jan-June 2014. This has recently been disclosed in ADB's web site. Involuntary Resettlement The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Three draft resettlement plans were prepared in consultation with affected persons in accordance with the ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed. The project requires minor land acquisition for construction of sanitary landfills and temporary impacts on vendors during construction, with no significant resettlement impacts anticipated. Special assistance measures will be made available to vulnerable groups. The resettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO, and adequate consultant inputs have been made available to support implementation and build capacity to managing resettlement impacts and social risks. The project has been reporting compliance to social safeguard related issues by the PIUs in the quarterly as well as semi anuual social safeguard monitoring report to the ADB. The third semi annual safeguard monitoring report covering the period of Jan-June 2014 has already been submitted. Indigenous Peoples The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Considering the urban locations of these subprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Urban services are limited outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations restrict further development in the valley, and there is an urgent need to improve the environment in potential urban centers to promote social and economic development in other regions of Nepal. The government, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the basis of (i) economic growth potential, (ii) demand for urban services, and (iii) urban management capacity. The project directly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP and Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work as catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the employment-centric, equitable, and inclusive economic growth emphasized by the approach paper. Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differentials in the needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets experience discrimination based on gender, caste, and ethnicity, and multiple exclusions constrain their progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is limited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress has been made through support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development partners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. During Project Implementation The project is in line with the Nepal country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity building, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. Reflecting lessons from similar projects, the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically integrated components, to simplify project administration and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable development impacts; (iii) fully involves stakeholders, including communities, in project identification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before project implementation; and (v) addresses enforcement of appropriate regulations as an essential element of managing urban infrastructure effectively. Therefore as envisioned by the Project, the project coordination office and project implementation units are doing consultation with the concerned stakeholders as and when needed and also been disseminating the relevant project related information to the public. Also due consideration has been given for the meaningful participation of the concerned project stakeholders in reaching project related decisions.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Inforation about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 15 Dec 2010     * Fact-finding: 24 Aug 2011 to 06 Sep 2011     * Management Review Meeting: 06 Oct 2011     * Approval: 14 Feb 2012     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

Development Project ******     * Facebook     * Twitter     * LinkedIn     * Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The pace of urbanization in Nepal has increased markedly during 2001 2011 with an urban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national population growth of 1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was estimated to live in urban areas, up from 9.2% in 1991 and 13.9% in 2001. While global experience clearly demonstrates that urbanization is an important driver of economic development, the potential has not been adequately tapped in Nepal. In the absence of a stringent policy regulating and managing growth, uncontrolled and haphazard urban development has created numerous problems, including deficiencies in basic urban services; environmental degradation; encroachment on public land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement development. Most municipalities in Nepal lack properly engineered and operated sanitary landfills, and have limited and intermittent water supply services, poorly maintained road infrastructure, and inadequate drainage systems that cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai. The Local Self Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to municipalities, but the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a low level of institutional capacity make providing infrastructure facilities commensurate with the growing demand for services a major challenge. Poor health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by reducing labor productivity and educational attainment. Disease, associated economic burden, and premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable. **** Impact **** Improved urban environment in the municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Population in project municipalities have inclusively better access to improved municipal infrastructure and services. Progress Towards Outcome There are 10 consulting service packages in total: project management and support consultant (PMSC) in the PCO; GESI consultant for the GESI Unit; design and supervision consultants (DSCs) for the four project municipalities of Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar; and local nongovernment organization (NGO) services in the four project municipalities. Contracts have been awarded for all. Technical Bid Evaluation for the drainage and road subprojects at Nepalgunj and Siddharthanagar is in stage of finalization at PCO. ADB has already provided no objection to issue IFB for SWM projects at Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj. Design and Bid document of Dharan water supply project has been finalised. Similarly the design of the drainage and road project at Janakpur has been finalized and draft bidding document has been prepared. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs 1. Reliable municipal infrastructure developed 2. Community development programs undertaken and GESI capacity strengthened. 3. Project management and administration supported. Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress TBER of the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj drainage and road subprojects are in final stage at PCO. Final design and draft bidding document of Janakpur drainage and road subproject has been prepared. Progress mentioned above. ADB has already provided concurrence to issue IFB for the Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj SWM Subprojects. Regarding Janakpur SWM sub project, site has not yet been finalized due to social issues. To early to report. Design and Bid document has been finalised with a target to publish IFB by end of Oct 2014. Progress mentioned above. Project implementation is being done in this direction by mobilizing NGOs in Dharan, Janakpur, Siddharthanagar and Nepalgunj Municpalities. 84 TLOs and 3 Users committee formed have more than 33% of women representatives. Community developement proposals will adreess this issue. GESI operational guidelines is finalized and toolkits developed for the same. Log frame of GESI project is prepared. This has been done. PCO and PIUs formed and core staff appointed. Aduit report and quarterly reports are being submitted timely. Being complied though there is some delay in Janakpur sub projects. Implementaion ongoing in this direction. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: B Indigenous Peoples: C **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect The project is classified as environmental category B. Four initial environmental examinations including environmental management plans were prepared in accordance with ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws, and disclosed. Subprojects are not located in or near sensitive or protected areas, and the initial environmental examinations conclude that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management plans provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of short duration. The net environmental benefits will be positive and large, including reduced (i) urban flooding from improved drainage systems, (ii) environmental pollution from improved SWM, and (iii) health and hygiene status as well as the overall environmental sanitation situation of the selected povery clusters of the project municipalities will be improved through various software and hardware activities under small scale community infrastructure. Implementation arrangements in the PCO build on experience gained through ADB urban projects, and consultant support will enable the PIUs to manage environmental impacts. The PCO will provide environmental reports to ADB semiannually. The project had alredy submitted Semi annual environmental safeguard monitorting report covering the period of Jan-June 2014. This has recently been disclosed in ADB's web site. Involuntary Resettlement The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Three draft resettlement plans were prepared in consultation with affected persons in accordance with the ADB s Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed. The project requires minor land acquisition for construction of sanitary landfills and temporary impacts on vendors during construction, with no significant resettlement impacts anticipated. Special assistance measures will be made available to vulnerable groups. The resettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO, and adequate consultant inputs have been made available to support implementation and build capacity to managing resettlement impacts and social risks. The project has been reporting compliance to social safeguard related issues by the PIUs in the quarterly as well as semi anuual social safeguard monitoring report to the ADB. The third semi annual safeguard monitoring report covering the period of Jan-June 2014 has already been submitted. Indigenous Peoples The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Considering the urban locations of these subprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Urban services are limited outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations restrict further development in the valley, and there is an urgent need to improve the environment in potential urban centers to promote social and economic development in other regions of Nepal. The government, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the basis of (i) economic growth potential, (ii) demand for urban services, and (iii) urban management capacity. The project directly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP and Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work as catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the employment-centric, equitable, and inclusive economic growth emphasized by the approach paper. Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differentials in the needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets experience discrimination based on gender, caste, and ethnicity, and multiple exclusions constrain their progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is limited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress has been made through support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development partners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. During Project Implementation The project is in line with the Nepal country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity building, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. Reflecting lessons from similar projects, the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically integrated components, to simplify project administration and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable development impacts; (iii) fully involves stakeholders, including communities, in project identification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before project implementation; and (v) addresses enforcement of appropriate regulations as an essential element of managing urban infrastructure effectively. Therefore as envisioned by the Project, the project coordination office and project implementation units are doing consultation with the concerned stakeholders as and when needed and also been disseminating the relevant project related information to the public. Also due consideration has been given for the meaningful participation of the concerned project stakeholders in reaching project related decisions.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Inforation about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 15 Dec 2010     * Fact-finding: 24 Aug 2011 to 06 Sep 2011     * Management Review Meeting: 06 Oct 2011     * Approval: 14 Feb 2012     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

The project directly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP and Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work as catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the employment-centric, equitable, and inclusive economic growth emphasized by the approach paper. Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differentials in the needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets experience discrimination based on gender, caste, and ethnicity, and multiple exclusions constrain their progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is limited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress has been made through support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development partners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. During Project Implementation The project is in line with the Nepal country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity building, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. Reflecting lessons from similar projects, the project (i) focuses on a small number of physically integrated components, to simplify project administration and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities with relatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable development impacts; (iii) fully involves stakeholders, including communities, in project identification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before project implementation; and (v) addresses enforcement of appropriate regulations as an essential element of managing urban infrastructure effectively. Therefore as envisioned by the Project, the project coordination office and project implementation units are doing consultation with the concerned stakeholders as and when needed and also been disseminating the relevant project related information to the public. Also due consideration has been given for the meaningful participation of the concerned project stakeholders in reaching project related decisions.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Inforation about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 15 Dec 2010     * Fact-finding: 24 Aug 2011 to 06 Sep 2011     * Management Review Meeting: 06 Oct 2011     * Approval: 14 Feb 2012     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

Print     * E-mail     * PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** The rapid urban population growth, coupled with the Government?s inability to keep pace with the demand for infrastructure and services has led to a series of urban environmental concerns in the secondary towns and constraining the economic growth of Nepal. Urban sector economy plays a key role for providing services and employment opportunities to the rural hinterland. Nepal?s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) (2005-2009) promotes investments to meet the urgent need for safe water supply and sanitation services in urban areas observing rapid urbanization, aiming to foster inclusive social development. Nepal is ranked 142nd out of 177 countries in terms of human development index shown in the Human Development Report 2007/2008, which clearly warrants further needs of social development. Although proportion of population with access to clean drinking water is reported at rather high 76.6% in 2006 by the Government, figures substantially vary depending on the source, and water supply is still considered insufficient in both volume and quality even in Kathmandu, the capital. Situation for sanitation and solid waste management is even worse, thus necessitating urgent intervention in these sub-sectors. Investments in these sub-sectors in selected secondary towns, catching up with the rapid and haphazard urbanization, are essential for providing clean and developed urban environment in line with the National Urban Policy (NUP) 2007. Moreover, the CSP and NUP address the need to strengthen rural-urban connectivity for promoting broad-based economic growth. Therefore, other urban infrastructure, such as improvement of road network, bus terminals and markets, would play an important role in enhancing rural-urban links. These approaches are still valid and confirmed in Nepal Country Operations Business Plan (2008-2010) and the latest Country Programming Mission conducted in April 2008, though the political and security context in Nepal has changed since the preparation of the CSP. The proposed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and ensuing Project intends to support the Government for an inclusive social development and broad-based economic growth through provision of environmental and other urban infrastructure in selected secondary towns by taking an integrated approach. The Project will build on the lessons learned under the on-going Urban and Environmental Improvement Project (Loan 1966-NEP), in particular in terms of implementation framework and financial arrangement. **** Impact **** Improved quality of life and higher economic growth in selected secondary towns in Nepal. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Project design and feasibility study that the borrower and ADB have agreed upon. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs The PPTA plans to deliver the following two main outputs: (i) preparation of feasibility study; and (ii) formulation of appropriate institutional and implementation framework. The first component will strategically select three to five target secondary towns with high economic growth potential and urgent needs for urban environmental improvement and supplementary urban facilities in line with the relevant development policy and strategy, after carefully examining commitment, capacity and readiness of candidate secondary towns. Then, the work is carried out to identify sub-projects and prepare overall investment package, including safeguard reports. The investment package will cover provision of infrastructure for urban environmental improvement mainly for household services such as water supply, sanitation (wastewater treatment), drainage and solid waste management, and supplementary urban facilities such as urban road, bus terminals, city parks and markets, and may include seed money for land pooling. Moreover, economic activities such as cold storage facilities may be considered under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Social and poverty assessment will be undertaken and mechanisms for improving access to and quality of basic urban services for the poor will be assessed. The second component will include institutional assessment of central as well as local bodies, from technical, financial and managerial viewpoints. On the basis of review of current status and direction of decentralization/devolution, appropriate institutional and financial arrangements will be proposed, together with comprehensive capacity building programs. These two components will be implemented in tandem in a closely coordinated manner. The PPTA will be implemented over a period of 8 months in two phases. The first phase of the PPTA will be executed in 3 months, when three to five target secondary towns will be determined. The second phase will be implemented over a period of 5 months for preparation of overall investment package and formulation of institutional and implementation framework. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: B Involuntary Resettlement: Indigenous Peoples: **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** The PPTA will undertake socioeconomic surveys, and prepare resettlement plans and environmental assessment reports such as initial environmental examination (IEE) for subprojects, as needed. Though subprojects are not expected to impose significant adverse environmental and social impacts, safeguard plans will be carefully developed in order to obtain public acceptance and thus not cause potential delay in implementation. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design Discussions will be held with officials of relevant government ministries and departments, and development partners including NGOs actively engaged in urban environmental improvement.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 04 Jul 2008     * Fact-finding: 09 Jul 2008 to 16 Jul 2008     * Approval: 02 Dec 2008     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

PDF     * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** ADB's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nepal (2005 ? 2009) rests on three pillars of which fostering inclusive social development is one. The three sub- sectors prioritized under this pillar are (i) education, (ii) water supply, sanitation and urban development, and (iii) social protection. While the strategy emphasizes on building social protection initiatives within the project design, it also identified the need to build capacity in social protection institutions in Nepal. The CPS is in line with ADB's Strategy 2020, which places emphasis on promoting greater access to opportunities by expanding human capacities through investments in education, health and basic social protections; as well as with the government's development strategy which has been increasingly expressing its deep commitment to social justice and equity and is striving to expand its safety net and social protection coverage. Nepal has had in place an old-age pension scheme and benefits to widows and the disabled since 1994. Since the current fiscal year, the government has expanded this coverage by lowering the age limit and expanding its cash-transfer scheme to certain caste/ethnic groups. The allowance has also been increased. However, there are no child centered cash-transfer schemes at the moment despite strong evidence that child protection measures can have significant impacts on the health of children and their consequent contribution to society. Many studies on early child brain development, including a study done by ADB shows that child development is at the core of human development theory and that the most critical period of brain development is in the first three years of life, proper nutrition being a critical factor in healthy brain development. It is estimated that more than half of Nepal's under-five children are stunted for their age, and despite significant decrease in infant mortality rates, over 40,000 under-one children are still dying in Nepal every year. A study conducted in 1999 revealed that of the 95,000 under-five child deaths in Nepal every year, about 54% were attributed to moderate and severe malnutrition, with the ""moderates"" responsible for most of the deaths. It has been proven that mental stunting resulting from malnutrition is irreversible and the World Bank estimated in 2007 that malnutrition in children in Nepal causes a GDP loss of around 3% per year. Thus, studies have shown that the highest human capital rates of return can be achieved from social protection targeting pre-school children. Confounding to these problems is a recent food alert by the World Food Programme in Nepal, warning of an impending food shortage, particularly in the mid- and far-western hills of Nepal due to low winter precipitation. Undoubtedly, children would be impacted the most. In 2008 UNICEF and WFP conducted an exploratory survey to see how child benefit cash transfers would be used by households. The study revealed that more than 40% of the money from cash transfers to mothers would be spent on supplementary food for children, around 30% on children's education and 11% or more on health care. Evidence from another ADB project also demonstrated that women who were provided cash transfers did have control over the money, and most of the allowance provided to cover ""basic needs"" was spent on food, house maintenance, medicine, education, clothing and household supplies, in that order of priority. Thus, the justification to provide a monthly cash allowance and its direct relevance to poverty reduction is more than evident for this project. **** Impact **** Reduction in child malnutrition in the project districts **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Enhanced execution of social protection programs **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs Enhanced capacity of local bodies in the project districts to deliver the child grant Enhanced capacity of the government to design efficient and evidence- based social protection programs Enhanced networking between local bodies, health facilities, and communities in the project districts for improving child nutrition Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress Output: Enhanced capacity of local bodies in the project districts to deliver the child grant - Social protection Officers (SPOs) mobilized at the districts since December 2012. However, currently, there is only one SPO remaining. The EA is in the process of filling the vacancies. - In case of social protection volunteers (SPVs), although the contract was signed on 23 January 2014, failure of the recruited firm to perform well has led to the cancellation of the contract. The EA is in the process of formalizing the cancellation. - Management Information Specialists (MIS) contract signed on 23 January 2014. Output 2: Enhanced capacity of the government to design efficient and evidence- based social protection programs - A 2-day orientation and sharing workshop was conducted for local development officers and SPOs from five project districts and governance officers from UNICEF's mid- and far- western regional office. A 7-day capacity building training on social protection is also undertaken. - On finalization of National Social Protection Framework, the consulting firm has submitted the draft report. Comments on the draft report provided. - Manual on cash transfer completed (child grant operations manual consolidated into one comprehensive social protection operations manual) Output Enhanced networking between local bodies, health facilities, and communities in the project districts for improving child nutrition: - 1,169 FCHVs and 436 health facility staff trained. - Midline survey completed. Preliminary results are showing positive impacts of the child grant in the five project districts. **** Safeguard Categories **** Environment: C Involuntary Resettlement: C Indigenous Peoples: B **** Summary of Environmental and Social Aspects **** Environmental Aspect No adverse environmental impacts are anticipated as a result of project implementation. Involuntary Resettlement The project will not cause any involuntary resettlement. Indigenous Peoples The project will pay special attention to ensuring that the delivery systems will reach the indigenous and excluded groups. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design A fact finding mission was fielded intermittently from 21 October 2009 to 18 April 2010. The mission undertook a field visit to one of the Karnali districts (Dolpa) from 23 October 2009 to 5 November 2009 to assess the ground realities of implementing cash grants in the remote mountain districts of Nepal. A workshop was organized in Kathmandu on 11 December 2009 to debrief central government officials on the mission s field visit and to brainstorm on the ideas that had been proposed by the DDC staff and local villagers in Dolpa. Consultations were also held with development partners. During Project Implementation A midterm review of the project was undertaken during 1 - 5 April 2013 which held consultation with the relevant stakeholders. A review mission - following the extension of the physical completion date of the project from 8 June 2014 to 15 July 2015 - was undertaken during 7 - 19 July 2014. The mission held consultations with the relevant stakeholders.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 12 Aug 2008     * Fact-finding: 24 Oct 2009 to 18 Apr 2010     * Approval: 28 Feb 2011     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

This is expected to contribute to a reduction of the rural-urban poverty gap and increased food security for the poor, as a result of improved social protection measures taken by the Government of Nepal. The S-CDTA project design also takes into account two of the five drivers of change identified in the ADB Strategy 2020: (i) good governance and capacity development, by focusing on capacity building of central and local governments to plan and implement social policies more effectively; and (ii) knowledge solutions, by bringing in knowledge of international best practices in the field of social protection. **** Impact **** Government's social protection objectives met. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Strengthened capacity of government to manage social protection schemes.

  * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The TA objective is to enhance both institutional and human resource capacity of key government agencies in developing and using macroeconomic models and improve the national statistical system. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Institutional capacity for economic policy analysis in Nepal is weak and as a result, public policy formulation is often not based on a sound analytical foundation. The need for sound economic policy analysis has become even more critical over the years in view of the stagnating economic growth and for better understanding the evolving structur of Nepal?s economy, its increasing complexity and the interactions between different economic sectors. Economic policy analysis has also been constrained by Nepal?s weak national statistical system, particularly the lack of quality and timely macroeconomic data. Given the importance of reliable and timely macroeconomic data for policy analysis, ADB has also been assisting the Government in strengthening Nepal?s weak statistical system. Recent assistance in this respect includes: (i) TA 3451-NEP (completed in 2004): Strengthening the National Statistical System, which helped in developing a consolidated national statistical plan (CNSP), and improving compilation of the NA, agriculture statistics development and poverty monitoring, and (ii) TA 4460-NEP: Strengthening the National Accounts System (near completion), which supported migration of the national accounts to the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993, benchmarking and rebasing the national accounts estimates, and development of a system of compiling quarterly national accounts. Also, a diagnostic study was conducted on Nepal?s statistical system under RETA 6333: Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia Pacific Region, which recommended adoption of the CNSP without further delay and identified a broad range of long-term statistical capacity building (SCB) needs of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS, the main statistical agency) and other Government agencies. **** Impact **** Economic policies based on an improved statistical system (national accounts) and sound quantitative macroeconomic analysis. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Component A: (i) A more conducive legal and institutional environment for improving the national statistical system. (ii) A system of QNAcompilation established. Component B: Macroeconomic tools developed for short- to medium- term macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis. Progress Towards Outcome While the legal and institutional reforms are still underway, the system of compiling QNA data has been streamlined. NMEM is institutionalized and the DSGE model finalized. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs Component A: Enactment of the new Statistical Act, more autonomous CBS, and more functional National Statistical Council (NSC) Component A: Quarterly GDP estimates for FY2007 FY2010 Component B: Upgrade of the Nepal Macroeconomic Model (NMEM) Compoent B: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)-type model developed for Nepal Component B: User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress - Draft Statiscal Act being submitted to the Cabinet. - Quarterly GDP estimates for all sectors completed. - User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting prepared. - DSGE model finalized and submitted to NRB. - Upgradation of the NMEM completed. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design The project was included in the country program on the request of the Government (mainly Central Bureau of Statistics and Nepal Rastra Bank).

  * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The TA objective is to enhance both institutional and human resource capacity of key government agencies in developing and using macroeconomic models and improve the national statistical system. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Institutional capacity for economic policy analysis in Nepal is weak and as a result, public policy formulation is often not based on a sound analytical foundation. The need for sound economic policy analysis has become even more critical over the years in view of the stagnating economic growth and for better understanding the evolving structur of Nepal?s economy, its increasing complexity and the interactions between different economic sectors. Economic policy analysis has also been constrained by Nepal?s weak national statistical system, particularly the lack of quality and timely macroeconomic data. Given the importance of reliable and timely macroeconomic data for policy analysis, ADB has also been assisting the Government in strengthening Nepal?s weak statistical system. Recent assistance in this respect includes: (i) TA 3451-NEP (completed in 2004): Strengthening the National Statistical System, which helped in developing a consolidated national statistical plan (CNSP), and improving compilation of the NA, agriculture statistics development and poverty monitoring, and (ii) TA 4460-NEP: Strengthening the National Accounts System (near completion), which supported migration of the national accounts to the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993, benchmarking and rebasing the national accounts estimates, and development of a system of compiling quarterly national accounts. Also, a diagnostic study was conducted on Nepal?s statistical system under RETA 6333: Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia Pacific Region, which recommended adoption of the CNSP without further delay and identified a broad range of long-term statistical capacity building (SCB) needs of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS, the main statistical agency) and other Government agencies. **** Impact **** Economic policies based on an improved statistical system (national accounts) and sound quantitative macroeconomic analysis. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Component A: (i) A more conducive legal and institutional environment for improving the national statistical system. (ii) A system of QNAcompilation established. Component B: Macroeconomic tools developed for short- to medium- term macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis. Progress Towards Outcome While the legal and institutional reforms are still underway, the system of compiling QNA data has been streamlined. NMEM is institutionalized and the DSGE model finalized. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs Component A: Enactment of the new Statistical Act, more autonomous CBS, and more functional National Statistical Council (NSC) Component A: Quarterly GDP estimates for FY2007 FY2010 Component B: Upgrade of the Nepal Macroeconomic Model (NMEM) Compoent B: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)-type model developed for Nepal Component B: User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress - Draft Statiscal Act being submitted to the Cabinet. - Quarterly GDP estimates for all sectors completed. - User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting prepared. - DSGE model finalized and submitted to NRB. - Upgradation of the NMEM completed. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design The project was included in the country program on the request of the Government (mainly Central Bureau of Statistics and Nepal Rastra Bank). The TA was prepared in full consultation with the Government agencies. During Project Implementation Ongoing.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available. Information about proposed projects is tentative and indicative.  **** Projects ****     * Overview     * Details     * Financing     * Business_Opportunities     * Documents  **** Timetable ****     * Concept Clearance: 14 May 2008     * Fact-finding: 07 Jul 2008 to 25 Jul 2008     * Approval: 04 Nov 2008     Search/Browse_Projects * You are here *     * Projects     * Overview Page_Top © 2014 Asian Development Bank.     * Sitemap     * Website_FAQs     * Terms_of_Use     * E-mail_Alerts     * RSS     * Twitter     * Youtube     * Facebook     * Flickr     * Scribd     * LinkedIn =============================================================================== *** Asian Development Bank ***      Headquarters: 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila,      Philippines  +_63_2_632_4444  + 63 2 636 2444 ADB_Contacts Access_to_Information Fraud_&amp;_Corruption_Hotline (+_63_2_632_5004) *** Resources For ***     * Bond_Investors     * Businesses_and_Consultants     * Civil_Society     * Job_Seekers     * Journalists     * Private_Sector_Project_Investors *** Other ADB Sites ***     * ADB_Compliance_Review_Panel     * ADB_Institute_(ADBI)     * Asia_Pathways_(ADBI_Blog)     * Asia_Regional_Integration_Center     * Asian_Bonds_Online     * Asian_International_Economists_Network     * Asian_Development_Blog *** Alerts and Mobile Apps *** *** e-Alerts *** Sign_up_to_our_e-mail_alerts or subscribe_to_our_RSS_feeds to get the latest information from ADB. *** ADB Mobile Apps *** Get up-to-date news, information, and multimedia content on your mobile device with ADB_Mobile_Apps. =============================================================================== ADB encourages websites and blogs to link to its web pages.

  * Bookmark ***** Project Data Sheet (PDS): Details ***** **** Description **** The TA objective is to enhance both institutional and human resource capacity of key government agencies in developing and using macroeconomic models and improve the national statistical system. **** Project Rationale and Linkage to Country/Regional Strategy **** Institutional capacity for economic policy analysis in Nepal is weak and as a result, public policy formulation is often not based on a sound analytical foundation. The need for sound economic policy analysis has become even more critical over the years in view of the stagnating economic growth and for better understanding the evolving structur of Nepal?s economy, its increasing complexity and the interactions between different economic sectors. Economic policy analysis has also been constrained by Nepal?s weak national statistical system, particularly the lack of quality and timely macroeconomic data. Given the importance of reliable and timely macroeconomic data for policy analysis, ADB has also been assisting the Government in strengthening Nepal?s weak statistical system. Recent assistance in this respect includes: (i) TA 3451-NEP (completed in 2004): Strengthening the National Statistical System, which helped in developing a consolidated national statistical plan (CNSP), and improving compilation of the NA, agriculture statistics development and poverty monitoring, and (ii) TA 4460-NEP: Strengthening the National Accounts System (near completion), which supported migration of the national accounts to the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993, benchmarking and rebasing the national accounts estimates, and development of a system of compiling quarterly national accounts. Also, a diagnostic study was conducted on Nepal?s statistical system under RETA 6333: Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia Pacific Region, which recommended adoption of the CNSP without further delay and identified a broad range of long-term statistical capacity building (SCB) needs of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS, the main statistical agency) and other Government agencies. **** Impact **** Economic policies based on an improved statistical system (national accounts) and sound quantitative macroeconomic analysis. **** Project Outcome **** Description of Outcome Component A: (i) A more conducive legal and institutional environment for improving the national statistical system. (ii) A system of QNAcompilation established. Component B: Macroeconomic tools developed for short- to medium- term macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis. Progress Towards Outcome While the legal and institutional reforms are still underway, the system of compiling QNA data has been streamlined. NMEM is institutionalized and the DSGE model finalized. **** Implementation Progress **** Description of Project Outputs Component A: Enactment of the new Statistical Act, more autonomous CBS, and more functional National Statistical Council (NSC) Component A: Quarterly GDP estimates for FY2007 FY2010 Component B: Upgrade of the Nepal Macroeconomic Model (NMEM) Compoent B: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)-type model developed for Nepal Component B: User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting Status of Operation/Construction or Implementation Progress - Draft Statiscal Act being submitted to the Cabinet. - Quarterly GDP estimates for all sectors completed. - User manual to undertake the quantitative macroeconomic analysis and forecasting prepared. - DSGE model finalized and submitted to NRB. - Upgradation of the NMEM completed. **** Stakeholder Participation and Consultation **** During Project Design The project was included in the country program on the request of the Government (mainly Central Bureau of Statistics and Nepal Rastra Bank). The TA was prepared in full consultation with the Government agencies. During Project Implementation Ongoing.   Project Data Sheets (PDS) contain summary information on the project or program. Because the PDS is a work in progress, some information may not be included in its initial version but will be added as it becomes available.

Located in the Himalaya mountain range, the country is greatly impacted by global climate change and struggles with both water scarcity in some areas and increased flooding in others. Supporting progress toward a democratic, resilient and prosperous Nepal is a priority for U.S. development efforts. USAID_programs_in_Nepal seek to reinforce recent gains in peace and security, stabilize the transitional government, strengthen the delivery of essential social services, expand proven health interventions, and address the global challenges of food insecurity and climate change.  ***** LEARN MORE ***** Nepal_Country_Profile USAID/Nepal_Mission_Director  ***** Partnership Opportunities ***** Conflict_Management_and_Mitigation_Annual_Program_Statement_(APS)_2014 ***** Blog ***** Will_Our_Generation_be_Responsible_for_Killing_Off_the_Tiger?
